Actions are automated tasks that Rulesets performs based on validation results. The `on_success` and `on_failure` properties of a rule define which actions to take when validations pass or fail.

## Action Structure

Actions are defined in the `on_success` and `on_failure` arrays:

```yaml
on_success:
  - action1:
      # action parameters
  - action2:
      # action parameters

on_failure:
  - action3:
      # action parameters
  - action4:
      # action parameters
```

Each action has a type (its key) and type-specific parameters.

## Available Action Types

  <Card title="Comment" icon="comment" href="/actions/comment">

  </Card>

  </Card>
  <Card title="Merge" icon="code-merge" href="/actions/merge">

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Templates

Actions support template variables that are replaced with dynamic content:

- `{{ pull_request.user.login }}` - PR author's username
- `{{ pull_request.title }}` - PR title
- `{{ pull_request.body }}` - PR description
- `{{ pull_request.number }}` - PR number
- `{{ repository.name }}` - Repository name
- `{{ repository.full_name }}` - Full repository name (owner/repo)
- `{{ validation_summary }}` - Summary of all validation results

## Example Use Cases

### Adding Comments

Provide feedback on validation results:

```yaml
on_failure:
  - comment:
      body: |
        Thanks for your contribution! Please address the following issues:

        {{ validation_summary }}

        Feel free to ask if you need any help.
```

### Managing Labels

Add or remove labels based on validation results:

```yaml
on_success:
  - label:
      add: ["ready-for-review"]
      remove: ["needs-work"]

on_failure:
  - label:
      add: ["needs-work"]
      remove: ["ready-for-review"]
```

### Requesting Reviews

Automatically request reviews when validations pass:

```yaml
on_success:
  - requestReview:
      reviewers: ["username1", "username2"]
      teams: ["team-name"]
```

### Creating Checks

Update GitHub Checks with validation results:

```yaml
on_success:
  - checks:
      name: "PR Validator"
      conclusion: "success"
      title: "PR Validation Passed"
      summary: "All checks passed successfully!"

on_failure:
  - checks:
      name: "PR Validator"
      conclusion: "failure"
      title: "PR Validation Failed"
      summary: "{{ validation_summary }}"
```

## Advanced Example

A comprehensive automation workflow:

```yaml
ruleset:
  - name: "Production PR Workflow"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.synchronized"
      - "pull_request_review.submitted"
    if:
      - type: "branch"
        base:
          match: "main"
    validate:
      - type: "title"
        match: "^(feat|fix|docs): .+"
      - type: "approvals"
        count:
          min: 2
        require_code_owners: true
    on_success:
      - label:
          add: ["approved"]
          remove: ["needs-review", "needs-revision"]
      - checks:
          name: "PR Validator"
          conclusion: "success"
          title: "Ready to Merge"
          summary: "This PR has been approved and is ready to merge."
    on_failure:
      - label:
          add: ["needs-revision"]
          remove: ["approved"]
      - comment:
          body: |
            This PR needs some changes before it can be merged:

            {{ validation_summary }}

            Please update your PR to address these issues.
      - checks:
          name: "PR Validator"
          conclusion: "failure"
          title: "Changes Required"
          summary: "{{ validation_summary }}"
```

This example creates a complete workflow for production PRs that:

1. Validates PR title format and required approvals
2. Manages labels based on validation status
3. Adds comments with feedback when validation fails
4. Creates check runs to show status in GitHub UI
