title: "Assign Action"
description: "Automatically assign users to pull requests"
---

The Assign Action allows you to automatically assign users to pull requests based on validation results or other criteria. This helps ensure PRs get the right attention and establishes clear ownership.

## Configuration

<ParamField path="assignees" type="string | string[]">
  Username(s) to assign to the PR
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="remove" type="string | string[]">
  Username(s) to remove from PR assignees
</ParamField>

## Basic Usage

```yaml
on_success:
  - assign:
      assignees: ["username1", "username2"]
```

## Examples

### Simple Assignment

Assign specific users to the PR:

```yaml
on_success:
  - assign:
      assignees: ["project-lead", "qa-engineer"]
```

### Self-Assignment

Assign the PR to its author:

```yaml
on_success:
  - assign:
      assignees: ["@author"]
```

### Remove Assignees

Remove specific users from PR assignments:

```yaml
on_success:
  - assign:
      remove: ["previous-owner"]
```

### Combined Assignment

Add and remove assignees in one action:

```yaml
on_success:
  - assign:
      assignees: ["new-owner"]
      remove: ["previous-owner"]
```

## Special Annotations

The Assign Action supports special annotations:

| Annotation | Description                  |
| ---------- | ---------------------------- |
| `@author`  | Assigns the PR to its author |

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get Current Assignees">
    The action retrieves the current list of PR assignees
  </Step>
  <Step title="Process Special Annotations">
    It processes any special annotations like `@author`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add New Assignees">
    It adds any new assignees specified in `assignees`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Remove Assignees">
    It removes any assignees specified in `remove`
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Practical Use Cases

### Content Type Assignment

Assign PRs based on the type of content being changed:

```yaml
ruleset:
  - name: "Documentation Assignment"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
    if:
      - type: "files"
        modified:
          match: "docs/.*"
    on_success:
      - assign:
          assignees: ["docs-maintainer"]
      - label:
          add: ["documentation"]

  - name: "Frontend Assignment"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
    if:
      - type: "files"
        modified:
          match: "src/frontend/.*"
    on_success:
      - assign:
          assignees: ["frontend-lead"]
      - label:
          add: ["frontend"]

  - name: "Backend Assignment"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
    if:
      - type: "files"
        modified:
          match: "src/backend/.*"
    on_success:
      - assign:
          assignees: ["backend-lead"]
      - label:
          add: ["backend"]
```

### PR Size-Based Assignment

Assign different reviewers based on PR size:

```yaml
ruleset:
  - name: "Small PR"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
    if:
      - type: "size"
        files:
          max: 5
    on_success:
      - assign:
          assignees: ["junior-reviewer"]

  - name: "Large PR"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
    if:
      - type: "size"
        files:
          min: 10
    on_success:
      - assign:
          assignees: ["senior-reviewer", "tech-lead"]
      - comment:
          body: "This is a large PR, so both a senior reviewer and tech lead have been assigned."
```

### Ownership Transition

Transfer ownership when a PR moves to a new stage:

```yaml
ruleset:
  - name: "Ready for QA"
    when:
      - "pull_request.labeled"
    if:
      - type: "label"
        match: "ready-for-qa"
    on_success:
      - assign:
          assignees: ["qa-engineer"]
          remove: ["developer"]
      - comment:
          body: "This PR is now ready for QA and has been assigned to @qa-engineer."
```

### Custom Assignment by Author

Assign different reviewers based on the PR author:

```yaml
ruleset:
  - name: "Junior Developer PRs"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
    if:
      - type: "author"
        match: ["junior-dev-1", "junior-dev-2", "intern"]
    on_success:
      - assign:
          assignees: ["senior-mentor"]
      - comment:
          body: "@senior-mentor has been assigned to mentor on this PR."

  - name: "Standard Assignment"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
    if:
      - type: "author"
        ignore: ["junior-dev-1", "junior-dev-2", "intern"]
    on_success:
      - assign:
          assignees: ["team-lead"]
```

## Best Practices

<Check>Assign PRs based on relevance and expertise</Check>
<Check>Avoid assigning too many people to one PR</Check>
<Check>Balance workload across team members</Check>
<Check>Have clear ownership transitions</Check>

<Warning>
  Assignments create expectations - make sure assignees know their responsibilities
</Warning>

## Benefits of Automated Assignment

- **Clear Ownership**: Establishes who is responsible for the PR
- **Faster Response**: Gets the right eyes on the PR quickly
- **Balanced Workload**: Can be used to distribute review work
- **Streamlined Workflow**: Reduces manual assignment steps
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Can rotate assignees to spread knowledge

## Assignment vs. Review Requests

GitHub supports both assignees and review requests:

- **Assignees**: People responsible for the PR (typically 1-2 people)
- **Reviewers**: People asked to review the code (can be multiple)

Consider using the [Request Review Action](/actions/request-review) alongside the Assign Action for a complete workflow:

```yaml
on_success:
  - assign:
      assignees: ["project-owner"] # Overall responsibility
  - requestReview:
      reviewers: ["code-reviewer-1", "code-reviewer-2"] # People to review
```
