description: 'Add or update comments on pull requests'
---

The Comment Action allows you to automatically add or update comments on pull requests based on validation results. This is useful for providing feedback, instructions, or information to PR authors and reviewers.

## Configuration

<ParamField path="body" type="string" required>
  The content of the comment to add to the PR
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="create_new" type="boolean" default={true}>
  Whether to create a new comment (true) or update an existing one (false)
</ParamField>

## Basic Usage

```yaml
on_failure:
  - comment:
      body: "Please fix the issues with your PR"
```

## Examples

### Simple Comment

Add a basic comment when validations fail:

```yaml
on_failure:
  - comment:
      body: "Your PR doesn't meet our requirements. Please fix the issues."
```

### Detailed Feedback with Template Variables

Provide detailed feedback using template variables:

```yaml
on_failure:
  - comment:
      body: |
        Hello @{{ pull_request.user.login }},
        
        Thank you for your PR! There are some issues that need to be addressed:
        
        {{ validation_summary }}
        
        Please fix these issues and update your PR.
```

### Updating Existing Comments

Update the bot's previous comment instead of creating a new one:

```yaml
on_failure:
  - comment:
      body: |
        # PR Validation Results
        
        {{ validation_summary }}
        
        _Last updated: {{ current_date }}_
      create_new: false
```

### Conditional Success Messages

Provide positive feedback when validations pass:

```yaml
on_success:
  - comment:
      body: |
        ## All checks passed! âœ…
        
        Thank you for following our contribution guidelines.
        A maintainer will review your PR soon.
```

## Template Variables

The Comment Action supports these template variables:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `{{ pull_request.user.login }}` | PR author's username |
| `{{ pull_request.title }}` | PR title |
| `{{ pull_request.body }}` | PR description |
| `{{ pull_request.number }}` | PR number |
| `{{ repository.name }}` | Repository name |
| `{{ repository.full_name }}` | Full repository name (owner/repo) |
| `{{ validation_summary }}` | Summary of all validation results |

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Process Template">
    The action processes the comment body, replacing template variables with actual values
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check Settings">
    If `create_new` is false, it looks for a previous comment from the Rulesets bot
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update or Create">
    If an existing bot comment is found (and `create_new` is false), it updates that comment; otherwise, it creates a new comment
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Practical Use Cases

### Onboarding New Contributors

Provide guidance to first-time contributors:

```yaml
ruleset:
  - name: "First-time Contributor"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
    if:
      - type: "author"
        match: "{{ first_time_contributor }}"
    on_success:
      - commentbody: |
            ## Welcome to our project! ðŸ‘‹
            
            Thank you for your first contribution!

```

### CI Failure Summary

Summarize CI failures to save time:

```yaml
ruleset:
  - name: "CI Failure Summary"
    when:
      - "check_suite.completed"
    if:
      - type: "check_suite"
        status: "failure"
    on_success:
      - comment:
          body: |
            ## CI Failures Summary
            
            The following CI checks have failed:
            
            {{ ci_failures }}
            
            Please check the CI logs for details.
```

### Labeling Explanation

Explain why certain labels were added:

```yaml
ruleset:
  - name: "Large PR"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.synchronize"
    validate:
      - type: "size"
        files: 10
        total: 500
    on_failure:
      - label:
          add: ["large-pr"]
      - comment:
          body: |
            ## Large PR Detected
            
            This PR has been labeled as `large-pr` because it:
            {{ validation_summary }}
            
            Consider breaking it down into smaller, more focused PRs if possible.
```

## Best Practices

<Check>Use Markdown formatting to make comments readable and structured</Check>
<Check>Include actionable feedback that helps contributors fix issues</Check>
<Check>Use template variables to personalize comments</Check>
<Check>Set `create_new: false` to avoid cluttering PRs with multiple similar comments</Check>

<Warning>
  Avoid making comments too verbose or adding them too frequently, as this can be perceived as noisy
</Warning>

## Limitations

- Comments are always posted from the GitHub App's account
- Markdown formatting in comments is limited to what GitHub supports
- Template variables are limited to those provided by Rulesets
