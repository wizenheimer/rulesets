description: 'Automatically add or remove labels'
---

The Label Action allows you to automatically add or remove labels from pull requests based on validation results. This is useful for categorizing PRs, highlighting issues, or tracking progress through your workflow.

## Configuration

<ParamField path="add" type="string | string[]">
  Label(s) to add to the PR
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="remove" type="string | string[]">
  Label(s) to remove from the PR
</ParamField>

## Basic Usage

```yaml
on_success:
  - label:
      add: ["valid-pr"]
      remove: ["needs-work"]
```

## Examples

### Simple Labeling

Add a label when validations pass:

```yaml
on_success:
  - label:
      add: ["ready-for-review"]
```

### Multiple Labels

Add multiple labels at once:

```yaml
on_success:
  - label:
      add: ["validated", "ready-for-review", "passes-ci"]
```

### Conditional Labeling

Add different labels based on different rules:

```yaml
ruleset:
  - name: "Feature PR"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
    if:
      - type: "title"
        match: "^feat: .*"
    on_success:
      - label:
          add: ["feature"]

  - name: "Bug Fix PR"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
    if:
      - type: "title"
        match: "^fix: .*"
    on_success:
      - label:
          add: ["bug-fix"]
```

### State Management

Manage PR state through labels:

```yaml
ruleset:
  - name: "PR Approval State"
    when:
      - "pull_request_review.submitted"
    validate:
      - type: "approvals"
        count:
          min: 2
    on_success:
      - label:
          add: ["approved"]
          remove: ["needs-review", "changes-requested"]
    on_failure:
      - label:
          add: ["needs-review"]
          remove: ["approved"]
```

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get Current Labels">
    The action retrieves the current labels on the PR
  </Step>
  <Step title="Calculate Changes">
    It determines which labels need to be added and which need to be removed
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update Labels">
    It updates the PR with the new set of labels
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Use Cases

### Workflow Status

Track PR status in your workflow:

```yaml
ruleset:
  - name: "PR Status"
    when:
      - "pull_request.*"
    validate:
      - type: "title"
        match: "^(feat|fix|docs): .*"
      - type: "size"
        files: 15
    on_success:
      - label:
          add: ["ready-for-review"]
          remove: ["needs-work"]
    on_failure:
      - label:
          add: ["needs-work"]
          remove: ["ready-for-review"]
```

### PR Size Categories

Categorize PRs by size:

```yaml
ruleset:
  - name: "PR Size - Small"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.synchronize"
    if:
      - type: "size"
        files:
          max: 5
        total:
          max: 100
    on_success:
      - label:
          add: ["size: small"]
          remove: ["size: medium", "size: large"]

  - name: "PR Size - Medium"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.synchronize"
    if:
      - type: "size"
        files:
          min: 6
          max: 15
        total:
          min: 101
          max: 500
    on_success:
      - label:
          add: ["size: medium"]
          remove: ["size: small", "size: large"]

  - name: "PR Size - Large"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.synchronize"
    if:
      - type: "size"
        files:
          min: 16
        total:
          min: 501
    on_success:
      - label:
          add: ["size: large"]
          remove: ["size: small", "size: medium"]
```

### Component Labeling

Automatically label PRs based on the files they change:

```yaml
ruleset:
  - name: "Component - Frontend"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.synchronize"
    if:
      - type: "files"
        modified:
          match: "src/frontend/.*"
    on_success:
      - label:
          add: ["component: frontend"]

  - name: "Component - Backend"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.synchronize"
    if:
      - type: "files"
        modified:
          match: "src/backend/.*"
    on_success:
      - label:
          add: ["component: backend"]

  - name: "Component - Documentation"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.synchronize"
    if:
      - type: "files"
        modified:
          match: "docs/.*|README\\.md"
    on_success:
      - label:
          add: ["component: docs"]
```

## Best Practices

<Check>Use consistent label naming schemes</Check>
<Check>Create labels in your repository before using them in rules</Check>
<Check>Use color-coding to make labels more visually informative</Check>
<Check>Document what your labels mean in your contributing guidelines</Check>

<Warning>
  Avoid creating too many labels, as this can become confusing for contributors
</Warning>

## Limitations

- Labels must already exist in the repository
- Label names are case-sensitive
- You can't create new labels through this action
