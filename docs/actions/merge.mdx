description: 'Automatically merge pull requests'
---

The Merge Action allows you to automatically merge pull requests when they pass all validations. This is useful for automating routine merges, reducing manual work, and maintaining a consistent workflow.

## Configuration

<ParamField path="method" type="string" default="merge">
  Merge method to use: "merge", "squash", or "rebase"
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="commit_title" type="string">
  Custom title for the merge commit (supports templates)
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="commit_message" type="string">
  Custom message for the merge commit (supports templates)
</ParamField>

## Basic Usage

```yaml
on_success:
  - merge:
      method: "squash"
```

## Examples

### Simple Auto-Merge

Automatically merge PRs that pass all validations:

```yaml
on_success:
  - merge:
      method: "merge"
```

### Custom Commit Messages

Specify custom titles and messages for merge commits:

```yaml
on_success:
  - merge:
      method: "squash"
      commit_title: "{{ pull_request.title }} (#{{ pull_request.number }})"
      commit_message: |
        {{ pull_request.body }}
        
        Merged by Rulesets automation.
```

### Conditional Auto-Merge

Merge documentation PRs automatically after review:

```yaml
ruleset:
  - name: "Auto-merge Documentation Updates"
    when:
      - "pull_request_review.submitted"
    if:
      - type: "files"
        modified:
          match: "^(docs/|README.md|*.md)$"
      - type: "label"
        match: "documentation"
    validate:
      - type: "approvals"
        count:
          min: 1
    on_success:
      - merge:
          method: "squash"
          commit_title: "docs: {{ pull_request.title }}"
```

## Merge Methods

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Merge">
    Creates a merge commit that preserves all commit history from the PR branch.
    ```yaml
    merge:
      method: "merge"
    ```
    Best for: Preserving detailed history and context of changes.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Squash">
    Combines all PR commits into a single commit on the base branch.
    ```yaml
    merge:
      method: "squash"
    ```
    Best for: Keeping a clean, linear history on the main branch.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Rebase">
    Applies each commit from the PR branch individually onto the base branch.
    ```yaml
    merge:
      method: "rebase"
    ```
    Best for: Maintaining a linear history while preserving individual commits.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check Mergeability">
    The action first checks if the PR is mergeable
  </Step>
  <Step title="Process Templates">
    If custom commit titles or messages are provided, it processes the templates
  </Step>
  <Step title="Perform Merge">
    The action merges the PR using the specified method
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Error Handling

The Merge Action will fail under these conditions:
- PR has merge conflicts
- PR doesn't meet branch protection requirements
- Required status checks are failing
- User lacks permission to merge

When merge fails, the error will be logged but won't affect other actions.

## Use Cases

### Auto-Merge Dependency Updates

Automatically merge dependency updates that pass tests:

```yaml
ruleset:
  - name: "Auto-merge Dependencies"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.synchronize"
      - "check_suite.completed"
    if:
      - type: "author"
        match: ["dependabot", "renovate"]
      - type: "check_suite"
        status: "success"
    validate:
      - type: "size"
        files: 5
        ignore: ["package-lock.json", "yarn.lock"]
    on_success:
      - merge:
          method: "squash"
          commit_title: "chore(deps): {{ pull_request.title }}"
```

### Auto-Merge Typo Fixes

Automatically merge simple typo fixes after approval:

```yaml
ruleset:
  - name: "Auto-merge Typo Fixes"
    when:
      - "pull_request_review.submitted"
    if:
      - type: "title"
        match: "^fix\\(typo\\): .*"
      - type: "size"
        total: 50
    validate:
      - type: "approvals"
        count:
          min: 1
    on_success:
      - merge:
          method: "squash"
```

### Auto-Merge for Specific Labels

Merge PRs with specific labels after CI success:

```yaml
ruleset:
  - name: "Auto-merge Labeled PRs"
    when:
      - "check_suite.completed"
      - "pull_request.labeled"
    if:
      - type: "label"
        match: "auto-merge"
      - type: "check_suite"
        status: "success"
    validate:
      - type: "approvals"
        count:
          min: 2
    on_success:
      - merge:
          method: "merge"
```

## Best Practices

<Check>Use with appropriate validation checks to ensure quality</Check>
<Check>Consider branch protection rules when setting up auto-merge</Check>
<Check>Choose the merge method that best fits your workflow</Check>
<Check>Use custom commit messages to maintain a meaningful history</Check>

<Warning>
  Be cautious with auto-merge on critical branches - always include sufficient validation
</Warning>

## Security Considerations

- Only enable auto-merge for trusted contributors or with strict validation
- Ensure all required checks (tests, approvals) are passing before merge
- Consider limiting auto-merge to non-critical repositories or branches
- Maintain audit logs of auto-merged PRs
