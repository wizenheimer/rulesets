title: "Request Review Action"
description: "Automatically request reviews for pull requests"
---

The Request Review Action automatically assigns reviewers to pull requests, helping ensure that PRs get appropriate review from relevant team members or teams.

## Configuration

<ParamField path="reviewers" type="string | string[]">
  Usernames of individual reviewers to request
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="teams" type="string | string[]">
  Team slugs to request reviews from
</ParamField>

## Basic Usage

```yaml
on_success:
  - requestReview:
      reviewers: ["username1", "username2"]
      teams: ["frontend-team"]
```

## Examples

### Individual Reviewers

Request reviews from specific individuals:

```yaml
on_success:
  - requestReview:
      reviewers: ["tech-lead", "senior-developer"]
```

### Team Reviews

Request reviews from entire teams:

```yaml
on_success:
  - requestReview:
      teams: ["frontend-team", "design-team"]
```

### Special Annotations

Use special annotations for dynamic reviewers:

```yaml
on_success:
  - requestReview:
      reviewers: ["@author"] # Assigns the PR author (useful for FYI reviews)
```

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get Current Reviewers">
    The action retrieves the list of users and teams already requested as reviewers
  </Step>
  <Step title="Process Special Annotations">
    It processes any special annotations like `@author`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Filter Reviewers">
    It removes any reviewers who have already been requested or can't review (e.g., the PR author can't review their own PR)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Request Reviews">
    If there are new reviewers to request, it sends review requests to them
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Practical Use Cases

### Component-Based Reviewers

Assign reviewers based on which components are modified:

```yaml
ruleset:
  - name: "Frontend Review"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
    if:
      - type: "files"
        modified:
          match: "src/frontend/.*"
    on_success:
      - requestReview:
          teams: ["frontend-team"]
          reviewers: ["ui-lead"]

  - name: "Backend Review"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
    if:
      - type: "files"
        modified:
          match: "src/backend/.*"
    on_success:
      - requestReview:
          teams: ["backend-team"]
          reviewers: ["api-lead"]

  - name: "Database Changes Review"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
    if:
      - type: "files"
        modified:
          match: "src/database/.*"
    on_success:
      - requestReview:
          reviewers: ["database-admin", "schema-owner"]
```

### Security Review for Sensitive Changes

Request security team review for security-related changes:

```yaml
ruleset:
  - name: "Security Review"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
    if:
      - type: "files"
        modified:
          match: "(src/(auth|security)/.*|.*password.*\\.js)"
    on_success:
      - requestReview:
          teams: ["security-team"]
      - label:
          add: ["security-review"]
      - comment:
          body: |
            This PR contains changes to security-sensitive code.
            A security team review has been automatically requested.
```

### Documentation Review

Request documentation team review for docs changes:

```yaml
ruleset:
  - name: "Documentation Review"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
    if:
      - type: "files"
        modified:
          match: "(docs/.*|README\\.md)"
    on_success:
      - requestReview:
          teams: ["docs-team"]
      - label:
          add: ["documentation"]
```

### Random Reviewer Selection

Create a round-robin review system (requires additional setup):

```yaml
ruleset:
  - name: "Random Reviewer"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
    on_success:
      - requestReview:
          reviewers: ["{{ random_reviewer }}"] # Would require custom implementation
```

## Best Practices

<Check>Assign reviewers based on code ownership or expertise</Check>
<Check>Don't overwhelm individuals with too many review requests</Check>
<Check>Balance team and individual reviewer assignments</Check>
<Check>Consider workload and timezone differences</Check>

<Warning>
  Be mindful of reviewer fatigue; rotating reviewers can help distribute the workload
</Warning>

## Team Assignment Tips

When assigning team reviews:

1. **Team Structure**: Team names are in the format `organization/team-slug`
2. **Public Teams**: Make sure the teams are visible to the GitHub App
3. **Manage Expectations**: Set clear expectations about which team members should respond
4. **Review Policies**: Consider creating team review assignment policies

## Individual Reviewer Tips

When assigning individual reviewers:

1. **Required vs Optional**: Distinguish between required and optional reviewers
2. **Specialist Reviews**: Assign specialists for specific types of changes
3. **Cross-Training**: Occasionally assign reviewers from different teams for knowledge sharing
4. **Backup Reviewers**: Consider assigning backup reviewers for critical changes
