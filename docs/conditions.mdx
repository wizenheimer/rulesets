title: "Conditions"
description: "Filter when rules are applied"
---

Conditions (the `if` property) determine whether a rule should be applied based on various criteria. They allow you to target specific pull requests based on authors, branches, files, labels, and more.

## Condition Structure

Conditions are defined in the `if` array of a rule:

```yaml
if:
  - type: "condition_type"
    # condition parameters
  - type: "another_condition_type"
    # condition parameters
```

All conditions must pass for the rule to be applied. Each condition has a `type` and type-specific parameters.

## Available Condition Types

## Usage Examples

### Filter by Author

Only apply a rule to PRs from specific users:

```yaml
if:
  - type: "author"
    match: "username1" # Can also be an array: ["username1", "username2"]
```

### Filter by Branch

Only apply a rule to PRs targeting a specific branch:

```yaml
if:
  - type: "branch"
    base:
      match: "main"
```

### Filter by Files Changed

Only apply a rule when specific files are modified:

```yaml
if:
  - type: "files"
    modified:
      match: "src/backend/.+\\.js$"
```

### Filter by Label

Only apply a rule to PRs with specific labels:

```yaml
if:
  - type: "label"
    match: "bug" # Can also be an array: ["bug", "critical"]
```

### Multiple Conditions

All conditions must pass for the rule to be applied:

```yaml
if:
  - type: "branch"
    base:
      match: "main"
  - type: "label"
    match: "security"
  - type: "author"
    ignore: "dependabot"
```

This rule will only apply to PRs:

- Targeting the `main` branch, AND
- Labeled with `security`, AND
- Not created by `dependabot`

## Pattern Matching

Most conditions support pattern matching, which can be:

- Exact match: `"main"`
- Glob pattern: `"feat/*"`
- Regular expression: `"/^feat\/.+$/"`

<Note>
  When using regular expressions, enclose the pattern in forward slashes (`/pattern/`).
</Note>

## Complete Example

```yaml
ruleset:
  - name: "Frontend Code Review"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.synchronize"
    if:
      - type: "files"
        modified:
          match: "src/frontend/.+\\.(js|ts|jsx|tsx)$"
      - type: "branch"
        base:
          match: "main"
      - type: "author"
        ignore: "dependabot"
    validate:
      - type: "size"
        files: 10
    on_failure:
      - comment:
          body: "Frontend PRs should modify no more than 10 files"
```

This rule only applies to PRs that:

- Modify frontend JavaScript/TypeScript files
- Target the `main` branch
- Are not created by Dependabot
