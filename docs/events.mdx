Events are GitHub webhook events that trigger rule evaluation in Rulesets. The `when` property of a rule defines which events will cause the rule to be processed.

## Event Format

GitHub events follow the format `event_name.action`. For example:

- `pull_request.opened` - Triggered when a pull request is opened
- `pull_request_review.submitted` - Triggered when a review is submitted

## Using Wildcards

You can use wildcards to match multiple actions for an event:

```yaml
when:
  - "pull_request.*" # Matches any pull request action
```

This will trigger the rule for any pull request event, such as opened, edited, synchronized, etc.

## Multiple Event Types

You can specify multiple event types to trigger a rule:

```yaml
when:
  - "pull_request.opened"
  - "pull_request.edited"
  - "pull_request.synchronize"
```

## Best Practices

<Check>Be specific - only trigger rules on the events they need to run for</Check>
<Check>Group related events when a rule should run in similar situations</Check>
<Check>Consider performance by avoiding unnecessary triggers</Check>

<Warning>
  Use wildcards (e.g., `pull_request.*`) carefully as they may trigger rules more frequently than expected
</Warning>

## Examples

### Basic Event Trigger

```yaml
ruleset:
  - name: "Title Check"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.edited"
    validate:
      - type: "title"
        match: "^(feat|fix): .+"
```

### Comprehensive PR Lifecycle

```yaml
ruleset:
  - name: "PR Size Check"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.synchronize"
    validate:
      - type: "size"
        files: 10

  - name: "Required Approvals"
    when:
      - "pull_request_review.submitted"
      - "pull_request_review.dismissed"
    validate:
      - type: "approvals"
        count:
          min: 2

  - name: "Final Checklist"
    when:
      - "pull_request.ready_for_review"
    validate:
      - type: "taskList"
        include: ["Checklist"]
```

## Event Context

Each event provides different context data that can be used in validations and actions. The most common context data includes:

- Pull request details (title, body, number, state)
- Repository information (name, owner)
- User information (login, name)
- Labels, assignees, milestones
- Changed files (for certain events)

This context data is available for use in templates and for validators to check against.
