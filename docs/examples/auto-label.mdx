description: "Automatically categorize PRs with intelligent labeling"
---

This example shows how to implement comprehensive automatic labeling for pull requests based on various criteria including files changed, PR size, author team, and more.

## Configuration

```yaml
ruleset:
  # File-Based Auto-Labeling
  - name: "Component Labeling"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.synchronize"
    on_success:
      - label:
          remove:
            [
              "component: frontend",
              "component: backend",
              "component: docs",
              "component: infra",
            ]

  - name: "Frontend Changes"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.synchronize"
    if:
      - type: "files"
        modified:
          match: ["src/frontend/.*", ".*\\.(js|jsx|ts|tsx|css|scss)$"]
    on_success:
      - label:
          add: ["component: frontend"]

  - name: "Backend Changes"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.synchronize"
    if:
      - type: "files"
        modified:
          match: ["src/backend/.*", ".*\\.(java|go|py|rb)$"]
    on_success:
      - label:
          add: ["component: backend"]

  - name: "Documentation Changes"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.synchronize"
    if:
      - type: "files"
        modified:
          match: ["docs/.*", "README\\.md", ".*\\.md"]
    on_success:
      - label:
          add: ["component: docs"]

  - name: "Infrastructure Changes"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.synchronize"
    if:
      - type: "files"
        modified:
          match:
            [
              "infra/.*",
              ".*\\.(yaml|yml|tf)$",
              "Dockerfile",
              "docker-compose\\.yml",
            ]
    on_success:
      - label:
          add: ["component: infra"]

  # Size-Based Labeling
  - name: "PR Size Labeling"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.synchronize"
    on_success:
      - label:
          remove:
            ["size: small", "size: medium", "size: large", "size: x-large"]

  - name: "Small PR"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.synchronize"
    if:
      - type: "size"
        files:
          max: 3
        total:
          max: 100
    on_success:
      - label:
          add: ["size: small"]

  - name: "Medium PR"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.synchronize"
    if:
      - type: "size"
        files:
          min: 4
          max: 10
        total:
          min: 101
          max: 300
    on_success:
      - label:
          add: ["size: medium"]

  - name: "Large PR"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.synchronize"
    if:
      - type: "size"
        files:
          min: 11
          max: 20
        total:
          min: 301
          max: 500
    on_success:
      - label:
          add: ["size: large"]

  - name: "X-Large PR"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.synchronize"
    if:
      - type: "size"
        files:
          min: 21
        total:
          min: 501
    on_success:
      - label:
          add: ["size: x-large"]
```

## How It Works

This ruleset implements automatic labeling in two categories:

1. **Component Labeling**: Labels PRs based on the types of files changed (frontend, backend, docs, infrastructure)
2. **Size Labeling**: Labels PRs based on their size (small, medium, large, x-large)

The rules are designed to update the labels whenever a PR is opened or synchronized (new commits pushed).

## Extending the Example

### Change Type Labeling

Add labels based on the type of change:

```yaml
ruleset:
  - name: "Bug Fix Label"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.edited"
    if:
      - type: "title"
        match: "^fix: "
    on_success:
      - label:
          add: ["type: bug"]

  - name: "Feature Label"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.edited"
    if:
      - type: "title"
        match: "^feat: "
    on_success:
      - label:
          add: ["type: feature"]

  - name: "Docs Label"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.edited"
    if:
      - type: "title"
        match: "^docs: "
    on_success:
      - label:
          add: ["type: docs"]

  - name: "Refactor Label"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.edited"
    if:
      - type: "title"
        match: "^refactor: "
    on_success:
      - label:
          add: ["type: refactor"]
```

### Team-Based Labeling

Add labels based on the author's team:

```yaml
ruleset:
  - name: "Team Labeling"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
    on_success:
      - label:
          remove:
            ["team: frontend", "team: backend", "team: devops", "team: qa"]

  - name: "Frontend Team Label"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
    if:
      - type: "team"
        match: "myorg/frontend-team"
    on_success:
      - label:
          add: ["team: frontend"]

  - name: "Backend Team Label"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
    if:
      - type: "team"
        match: "myorg/backend-team"
    on_success:
      - label:
          add: ["team: backend"]

  - name: "DevOps Team Label"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
    if:
      - type: "team"
        match: "myorg/devops-team"
    on_success:
      - label:
          add: ["team: devops"]

  - name: "QA Team Label"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
    if:
      - type: "team"
        match: "myorg/qa-team"
    on_success:
      - label:
          add: ["team: qa"]
```

### Priority Labeling

Add priority labels based on PR description:

```yaml
ruleset:
  - name: "Priority Labeling"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.edited"
    on_success:
      - label:
          remove: ["priority: high", "priority: medium", "priority: low"]

  - name: "High Priority Label"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.edited"
    if:
      - type: "description"
        match: "Priority: High|High Priority|Urgent|Critical"
    on_success:
      - label:
          add: ["priority: high"]

  - name: "Medium Priority Label"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.edited"
    if:
      - type: "description"
        match: "Priority: Medium|Medium Priority"
    on_success:
      - label:
          add: ["priority: medium"]

  - name: "Low Priority Label"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.edited"
    if:
      - type: "description"
        match: "Priority: Low|Low Priority"
    on_success:
      - label:
          add: ["priority: low"]
```

### Status Labeling

Add status labels based on validation results:

```yaml
ruleset:
  - name: "PR Validation"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.synchronize"
      - "pull_request_review.submitted"
    validate:
      - type: "title"
        match: "^(feat|fix|docs|style|refactor|perf|test|build|ci|chore|revert): .+"
      - type: "approvals"
        count:
          min: 2
    on_success:
      - label:
          add: ["status: ready"]
          remove: ["status: needs-work", "status: review-required"]
    on_failure:
      - label:
          add: ["status: needs-work"]
          remove: ["status: ready"]
```

## Best Practices for Label Management

<Check>Create labels in your repository before using them in rules</Check>
<Check>Use a consistent naming scheme (e.g., "category: value")</Check>
<Check>Use colors to visually distinguish label categories</Check>
<Check>Document your labeling scheme for contributors</Check>

<Warning>
  Don't create too many labels or overly complex labeling rules, as they can become difficult to maintain
</Warning>

## Setting Up Required Labels

Before using this ruleset, create these labels in your repository:

1. Component labels:

   - `component: frontend` (color: #0366d6)
   - `component: backend` (color: #6f42c1)
   - `component: docs` (color: #0075ca)
   - `component: infra` (color: #d73a4a)

2. Size labels:

   - `size: small` (color: #c2e0c6)
   - `size: medium` (color: #fbca04)
   - `size: large` (color: #f9d0c4)
   - `size: x-large` (color: #e99695)

3. Type labels:

   - `type: bug` (color: #d73a4a)
   - `type: feature` (color: #0075ca)
   - `type: docs` (color: #0366d6)
   - `type: refactor` (color: #6f42c1)

4. Team labels:

   - `team: frontend` (color: #bfdadc)
   - `team: backend` (color: #c5def5)
   - `team: devops` (color: #dbedff)
   - `team: qa` (color: #d4c5f9)

5. Priority labels:

   - `priority: high` (color: #d73a4a)
   - `priority: medium` (color: #fbca04)
   - `priority: low` (color: #0e8a16)

6. Status labels:
   - `status: ready` (color: #0e8a16)
   - `status: needs-work` (color: #fbca04)
   - `status: review-required` (color: #d4c5f9)

## Benefits of Automatic Labeling

- **Consistency**: Ensures PRs are labeled consistently according to rules
- **Visibility**: Makes it easy to filter and search PRs
- **Workflow Integration**: Labels can be used to drive other automations
- **Reduced Manual Work**: Eliminates the need for manual labeling
- **Better Organization**: Helps teams manage large volumes of PRs
