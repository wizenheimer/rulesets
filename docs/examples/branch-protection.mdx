This example shows how to enforce branch naming conventions and implement protections for important branches using Rulesets.

## Configuration

```yaml
ruleset:
  # Branch Naming Convention
  - name: "Branch Naming Convention"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
    validate:
      - type: "branch"
        head:
          match: "^(feature|bugfix|hotfix|release)/[a-z0-9-_]+"
          message: "Branch name must follow pattern: type/description (e.g., feature/add-login)"
    on_failure:
      - comment:
          body: |
            Your branch name doesn't follow our naming convention.
            Please use one of these prefixes followed by a descriptive name:
            - feature/
            - bugfix/
            - hotfix/
            - release/

            Examples: `feature/user-authentication`, `bugfix/login-error`

            {{ validation_summary }}

  # Protected Main Branch
  - name: "Main Branch Protection"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.synchronize"
      - "pull_request_review.submitted"
    if:
      - type: "branch"
        base:
          match: "main"
    validate:
      - type: "size"
        files: 10
        total: 300
      - type: "approvals"
        count:
          min: 2
        require_code_owners: true
    on_failure:
      - label:
          add: ["needs-work"]
      - comment:
          body: |
            ## Main Branch Protection

            PRs to the main branch have stricter requirements:

            - Limited size (max 10 files, 300 lines total)
            - At least 2 approvals including code owners

            {{ validation_summary }}

  # Feature to Develop Only
  - name: "Feature Branch Flow"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
    if:
      - type: "branch"
        head:
          match: "^feature/.*"
        base:
          match: "main"
    validate:
      - type: "branch"
        base:
          match: "develop"
          message: "Feature branches must target develop, not main"
    on_failure:
      - comment:
          body: |
            ## Incorrect Branch Target

            Feature branches should be merged into `develop` first, not directly to `main`.

            Please close this PR and create a new one targeting the `develop` branch.
```

## How It Works

This ruleset implements three important branch protection patterns:

1. **Branch Naming Convention**: Ensures all feature branches follow a consistent naming pattern
2. **Main Branch Protection**: Applies stricter validation for PRs targeting the main branch
3. **Feature Branch Flow**: Enforces a workflow where feature branches must target develop, not main

## Extending the Example

### Branch Prefixes by Type

Enforce different branch prefixes based on the type of change:

```yaml
ruleset:
  - name: "Feature Branch Names"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
    if:
      - type: "title"
        match: "^feat: .*"
    validate:
      - type: "branch"
        head:
          match: "^feature/.*"
    on_failure:
      - comment:
          body: "Feature PRs should come from branches starting with 'feature/'"

  - name: "Bugfix Branch Names"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
    if:
      - type: "title"
        match: "^fix: .*"
    validate:
      - type: "branch"
        head:
          match: "^(bugfix|hotfix)/.*"
    on_failure:
      - comment:
          body: "Bug fix PRs should come from branches starting with 'bugfix/' or 'hotfix/'"
```

### Jira Integration

Enforce Jira ticket references in branch names:

```yaml
validate:
  - type: "branch"
    head:
      match: "^(feature|bugfix|hotfix)/[A-Z]+-[0-9]+-[a-z0-9-]+"
      message: "Branch name must include Jira issue ID (e.g., feature/PROJ-123-description)"
```

### Team-Specific Branches

Apply different naming conventions for different teams:

```yaml
ruleset:
  - name: "Frontend Team Branches"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
    if:
      - type: "team"
        match: "org/frontend-team"
    validate:
      - type: "branch"
        head:
          match: "^frontend/.*"
    on_failure:
      - comment:
          body: "Frontend team branches should start with 'frontend/'"

  - name: "Backend Team Branches"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
    if:
      - type: "team"
        match: "org/backend-team"
    validate:
      - type: "branch"
        head:
          match: "^backend/.*"
    on_failure:
      - comment:
          body: "Backend team branches should start with 'backend/'"
```

### Release Branch Restrictions

Enforce special rules for release branches:

```yaml
ruleset:
  - name: "Release Branch Protection"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.synchronize"
    if:
      - type: "branch"
        head:
          match: "^release/.*"
    validate:
      - type: "approvals"
        count:
          min: 3
        include: ["release-manager"]
      - type: "label"
        include: ["release-approved"]
    on_failure:
      - comment:
          body: |
            ## Release Branch Requirements

            Release branches have special requirements:
            - 3+ approvals including the release manager
            - Must have 'release-approved' label

            {{ validation_summary }}
```

## Branch Protection Strategy

Implement a complete branch protection strategy with these components:

### GitHub Branch Protection Settings

First, set up GitHub branch protection rules for important branches:

1. Go to Repository Settings → Branches → Branch protection rules
2. Add rules for `main` and `develop` branches:
   - Require pull request reviews
   - Require status checks to pass
   - Restrict who can push

### Complementary Ruleset Configuration

Then use Rulesets to add more sophisticated validations:

```yaml
ruleset:
  - name: "Develop Branch PRs"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.synchronize"
    if:
      - type: "branch"
        base:
          match: "develop"
    validate:
      - type: "size"
        files: 20
        total: 500
      - type: "approvals"
        count:
          min: 1
    on_success:
      - label:
          add: ["ready-to-merge"]
    on_failure:
      - label:
          add: ["needs-work"]

  - name: "Main Branch PRs"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.synchronize"
    if:
      - type: "branch"
        base:
          match: "main"
    validate:
      - type: "branch"
        head:
          match: ["develop", "hotfix/.*", "release/.*"]
          message: "Only develop, hotfix, or release branches can target main"
      - type: "approvals"
        count:
          min: 2
        require_code_owners: true
    on_success:
      - label:
          add: ["production-ready"]
    on_failure:
      - label:
          add: ["needs-review"]
```

## Benefits

- **Consistency**: Enforces consistent branch naming across the team
- **Quality Control**: Applies appropriate validation based on branch type and target
- **Workflow Enforcement**: Ensures your Git workflow is followed correctly
- **Automated Feedback**: Provides clear guidance when conventions aren't followed
- **Reduced Human Error**: Prevents accidental merges to protected branches
