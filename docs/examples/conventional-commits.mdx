This example shows how to enforce the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format in your pull requests, ensuring a consistent and meaningful commit history.

## Complete Configuration

````yaml
ruleset:
  - name: "Conventional Commit Format"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.edited"
      - "pull_request.synchronize"
    validate:
      - type: "title"
        match: "^(feat|fix|docs|style|refactor|perf|test|build|ci|chore|revert)(\\(\\w+\\))?: .+"
        message: "PR title must follow conventional commit format: type(scope): description"
      - type: "commit"
        match: "^(feat|fix|docs|style|refactor|perf|test|build|ci|chore|revert)(\\(\\w+\\))?: .+"
        message: "All commits must follow conventional commit format"
        ignore_merge_commits: true
    on_success:
      - label:
          add: ["conventional-format"]
    on_failure:
      - comment:
          body: |
            ## Invalid Commit Format

            Please format your title and commits according to the Conventional Commits specification:

            ```
            <type>(<optional scope>): <description>

            [optional body]

            [optional footer(s)]
            ```

            Where `type` is one of: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, build, ci, chore, revert

            Example: `feat(user): add login functionality`

            {{ validation_summary }}
````

## How It Works

This ruleset:

1. Triggers when a PR is opened, edited, or synchronized
2. Validates that the PR title follows the Conventional Commits format
3. Validates that all commit messages follow the Conventional Commits format (ignoring merge commits)
4. Adds a "conventional-format" label when validations pass
5. Comments with guidance when validations fail

## Key Components

### Title Validation

The title validator ensures the PR title follows the format `type(scope): description`:

```yaml
validate:
  - type: "title"
    match: "^(feat|fix|docs|style|refactor|perf|test|build|ci|chore|revert)(\\(\\w+\\))?: .+"
```

### Commit Validation

The commit validator ensures all commit messages follow the same format:

```yaml
validate:
  - type: "commit"
    match: "^(feat|fix|docs|style|refactor|perf|test|build|ci|chore|revert)(\\(\\w+\\))?: .+"
    ignore_merge_commits: true
```

Setting `ignore_merge_commits: true` prevents validation failures on automatically generated merge commits.

### Feedback Mechanism

When validations fail, a detailed comment is added to guide contributors:

```yaml
on_failure:
  - comment:
      body: |
        ## Invalid Commit Format

        Please format your title and commits according to the Conventional Commits specification:

        # ... detailed explanation and example ...
```

## Customization Options

You can customize this ruleset in several ways:

### Modified Type List

If you want to use a different set of types:

```yaml
match: "^(feature|bugfix|documentation|refactor|performance|test): .+"
```

### Require Scope

If you want to make the scope mandatory:

```yaml
match: "^(feat|fix|docs)(\\([a-z0-9-]+\\)): .+"
```

### First Commit Only

For workflows that squash commits, validate only the first commit:

```yaml
validate:
  - type: "commit"
    match: "^(feat|fix|docs).*"
    first_only: true
```

## Implementation Tips

1. **Provide Templates**: Create PR templates that include the conventional format
2. **Setup Git Hooks**: Use tools like [commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/) locally
3. **Educate Contributors**: Link to the Conventional Commits documentation in your README
4. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic validation and gradually add complexity

## Benefits

- **Automated Changelogs**: Tools can parse conventional commits to generate changelogs
- **Clear Intent**: The commit type instantly communicates the purpose of a change
- **Semantic Versioning**: Types like "feat" and "fix" can trigger appropriate version bumps
- **Better History**: Makes your repository history more meaningful and navigable
