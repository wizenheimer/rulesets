title: "PR Size Limits Example"
description: "Enforce manageable PR sizes with automatic labeling and feedback"
---

This example shows how to enforce size limits on pull requests and provide helpful feedback to contributors, encouraging smaller, more focused changes.

## Configuration

```yaml
ruleset:
  # Rule 2: PR Size Limits
  - name: "PR Size Check"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.synchronize"
    validate:
      - type: "size"
        files: 10
        total: 500
        addition: 400
        deletion: 200
        message: "This PR is too large. Please split it into smaller PRs."
    on_failure:
      - label:
          add: ["large-pr"]
      - comment:
          body: |
            ## Large Pull Request Detected

            This PR exceeds our size guidelines:

            {{ validation_summary }}

            Large PRs are harder to review and more likely to introduce bugs. Please consider:

            - Breaking this change into multiple smaller PRs
            - Focusing each PR on a single concern
            - Removing unnecessary changes or generated files

            If this large PR is absolutely necessary, please provide a detailed explanation.
```

## How It Works

This ruleset:

1. Triggers when a PR is opened or synchronized (new commits pushed)
2. Validates that the PR doesn't exceed size limits:
   - Maximum 10 files changed
   - Maximum 500 total lines changed
   - Maximum 400 lines added
   - Maximum 200 lines deleted
3. When the PR is too large:
   - Adds a "large-pr" label
   - Comments with guidance on how to address the issue

## Extending the Example

### Ignore Certain Files

Exclude files that often change in bulk but don't require careful review:

```yaml
validate:
  - type: "size"
    files: 10
    total: 500
    ignore:
      - "package-lock.json"
      - "yarn.lock"
      - "*.generated.ts"
      - "*.min.js"
    message: "This PR is too large (excluding dependency lock files and generated code)."
```

### Size-Based Labeling

Automatically label PRs based on their size:

```yaml
ruleset:
  - name: "Remove Size Labels"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.synchronize"
    on_success:
      - label:
          remove:
            ["size: small", "size: medium", "size: large", "size: x-large"]

  - name: "Small PR"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.synchronize"
    if:
      - type: "size"
        files:
          max: 3
        total:
          max: 100
    on_success:
      - label:
          add: ["size: small"]

  - name: "Medium PR"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.synchronize"
    if:
      - type: "size"
        files:
          min: 4
          max: 10
        total:
          min: 101
          max: 300
    on_success:
      - label:
          add: ["size: medium"]

  - name: "Large PR"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.synchronize"
    if:
      - type: "size"
        files:
          min: 11
          max: 20
        total:
          min: 301
          max: 500
    on_success:
      - label:
          add: ["size: large"]

  - name: "X-Large PR"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.synchronize"
    if:
      - type: "size"
        files:
          min: 21
        total:
          min: 501
    on_success:
      - label:
          add: ["size: x-large"]
      - comment:
          body: |
            ## Extra Large Pull Request

            This PR is very large and may take longer to review.
            Consider breaking it into smaller, more focused PRs if possible.
```

### Different Limits by Branch

Set stricter limits for important branches:

```yaml
ruleset:
  - name: "Main Branch Size Limits"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.synchronize"
    if:
      - type: "branch"
        base:
          match: "main"
    validate:
      - type: "size"
        files: 5
        total: 200
    on_failure:
      - label:
          add: ["large-pr", "needs-split"]
      - comment:
          body: |
            ## PR Too Large for Main Branch

            PRs targeting the main branch must be small and focused.
            Please split this PR into smaller changes.

            {{ validation_summary }}

  - name: "Development Branch Size Limits"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.synchronize"
    if:
      - type: "branch"
        base:
          match: "develop"
    validate:
      - type: "size"
        files: 15
        total: 800
    on_failure:
      - label:
          add: ["large-pr"]
      - comment:
          body: |
            ## Large PR

            This PR exceeds our recommended size limits.

            {{ validation_summary }}
```

## Strategies for Managing Large PRs

Include helpful advice in your feedback:

```yaml
on_failure:
  - comment:
      body: |
        ## Large Pull Request Detected

        This PR exceeds our size guidelines. Here are some strategies to make it more manageable:

        1. **Split by feature**: Create separate PRs for each logical feature or change
        2. **Split by layer**: Separate backend/frontend/UI changes into different PRs
        3. **Split by directory**: Create PRs based on directories or components
        4. **Split by steps**: Submit refactoring before adding new features

        Remember that smaller PRs:
        - Get reviewed faster
        - Are more likely to be approved
        - Have fewer bugs
        - Provide quicker feedback

        If splitting isn't possible, please explain why in the PR description.
```

## Implementation Tips

1. **Start with generous limits**: Begin with larger limits and gradually reduce them
2. **Educate your team**: Explain the benefits of smaller PRs
3. **Lead by example**: Have maintainers model good PR practices
4. **Make exceptions when needed**: Some valid changes (like major refactoring) might need to be larger
5. **Set up your workflow**: Use branch protection rules alongside Rulesets

## Benefits

- **Higher quality code**: Smaller PRs get more thorough reviews
- **Faster cycle time**: PRs move through the review process more quickly
- **Better collaboration**: Reviewers are more willing to review smaller changes
- **Lower cognitive load**: Reviewers can focus on one concern at a time
- **Smoother integration**: Smaller changes integrate more easily with the codebase
