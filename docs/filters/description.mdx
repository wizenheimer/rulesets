title: "Description Filter"
description: "Filter rules based on PR description content"
---

The Description Filter allows you to apply rules only when a pull request's description contains (or doesn't contain) specific content. This helps target rules based on the context or purpose described in the PR.

## Configuration

<ParamField path="type" type="string" required>
  Must be set to `"description"`
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="match" type="string | string[]">
  Pattern(s) that the description should match (supports regex)
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="ignore" type="string | string[]">
  Pattern(s) that the description should not match (supports regex)
</ParamField>

## Basic Usage

```yaml
if:
  - type: "description"
    match: "breaking change"
```

## Examples

### Match Specific Text

Apply a rule only when the description contains specific text:

```yaml
if:
  - type: "description"
    match: "breaking change"
```

### Match Multiple Patterns

Apply a rule when the description matches any of several patterns:

```yaml
if:
  - type: "description"
    match: ["fixes #\\d+", "resolves #\\d+", "closes #\\d+"]
```

### Exclude Patterns

Apply a rule only when the description doesn't mention something:

```yaml
if:
  - type: "description"
    ignore: "WIP"
```

### Combined Matching

Apply a rule with both inclusion and exclusion patterns:

```yaml
if:
  - type: "description"
    match: "migration"
    ignore: ["revert", "rollback"]
```

## Pattern Matching

The Description Filter supports several pattern matching methods:

1. **Simple substring**: `"breaking change"`
2. **Regular expressions**: `"/fixes #\\d+/i"` (enclosed in forward slashes)

For case-insensitive matching with regex, use the `i` flag: `"/breaking change/i"`

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get Description">
    The filter retrieves the PR description from the GitHub event context
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check Match Patterns">
    If `match` is specified, it checks if the description matches any of the patterns
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check Ignore Patterns">
    If `ignore` is specified, it checks if the description matches any of the ignore patterns
  </Step>
  <Step title="Determine Result">
    Returns a match result based on whether the description satisfies all conditions
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Practical Use Cases

### Breaking Changes Workflow

Apply special rules to breaking changes:

```yaml
ruleset:
  - name: "Breaking Change Review"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.edited"
    if:
      - type: "description"
        match: "BREAKING CHANGE"
    on_success:
      - label:
          add: ["breaking-change"]
      - requestReview:
          reviewers: ["api-team-lead", "product-manager"]
      - comment:
          body: |
            ## Breaking Change Detected

            This PR includes a breaking change and requires additional reviews.

            Please ensure this change:
            - Is absolutely necessary
            - Is properly documented
            - Has a migration path for existing users
```

### Issue References

Apply different rules based on whether a PR references an issue:

```yaml
ruleset:
  - name: "Issue Reference Required"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.edited"
    if:
      - type: "description"
        ignore: ["fixes #\\d+", "closes #\\d+", "resolves #\\d+"]
    validate:
      - type: "description"
        match: "Issue: #\\d+"
    on_failure:
      - comment:
          body: |
            This PR doesn't appear to reference an issue.

            Please add a line like `Fixes #123` or `Issue: #123` to your description.
```

### Release Notes Draft

Apply specific rules to PRs with draft release notes:

```yaml
ruleset:
  - name: "Release Notes Check"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.edited"
    if:
      - type: "description"
        match: "## Release Notes"
    validate:
      - type: "description"
        length:
          min: 200
    on_failure:
      - comment:
          body: |
            Your PR includes a Release Notes section, but it appears too brief.

            Please provide more detailed release notes for user-facing changes.
```

### Work In Progress

Skip certain validations for work-in-progress PRs:

```yaml
ruleset:
  - name: "WIP PR"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.edited"
    if:
      - type: "description"
        match: "\\[WIP\\]|Work In Progress"
    on_success:
      - label:
          add: ["wip"]
      - comment:
          body: |
            This PR has been marked as a work in progress.

            Some validations will be skipped, but please mark it as ready for review when completed.

  - name: "Standard PR Validation"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.edited"
    if:
      - type: "description"
        ignore: "\\[WIP\\]|Work In Progress"
    validate:
      - type: "title"
        match: "^(feat|fix|docs): .+"
      - type: "description"
        no_empty: true
```

## Best Practices

<Check>Keep pattern matching simple and focused</Check>
<Check>Provide clear explanations for pattern requirements</Check>
<Check>Consider case sensitivity in your patterns</Check>
<Check>Use PR templates to encourage consistent descriptions</Check>

<Warning>
  Regex patterns can become complex; test them thoroughly to ensure they match as expected
</Warning>

## Integration with PR Templates

To make the most of the Description Filter, create a PR template with standard sections:

```markdown
<!-- .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md -->

## Description

<!-- Describe your changes in detail -->

## Related Issues

<!-- Link to related issues using the format: Fixes #123 -->

## Type of Change

<!-- Mark with an `x` all the checkboxes that apply -->

- [ ] Bug fix
- [ ] New feature
- [ ] Breaking change
- [ ] Documentation update

## Testing

<!-- Describe the testing you've done -->

## Checklist

<!-- Mark with an `x` all the checkboxes that apply -->

- [ ] I have updated the documentation accordingly
- [ ] I have added tests to cover my changes
- [ ] All new and existing tests passed
```

This template creates predictable sections that your Description Filter can target.
