title: "Files Filter"
description: "Filter rules based on modified files"
---

The Files Filter allows you to apply rules only when specific files are modified in a pull request. This is useful for creating targeted rules that apply only to certain parts of your codebase.

## Configuration

<ParamField path="type" type="string" required>
  Must be set to `"files"`
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="added" type="object">
  Conditions for added files
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="added.match" type="string | string[]">
  File patterns that should match for added files
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="added.ignore" type="string | string[]">
  File patterns that should not match for added files
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="modified" type="object">
  Conditions for modified files
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="modified.match" type="string | string[]">
  File patterns that should match for modified files
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="modified.ignore" type="string | string[]">
  File patterns that should not match for modified files
</ParamField>

## Basic Usage

```yaml
if:
  - type: "files"
    modified:
      match: "src/frontend/.*"
```

## Examples

### Match Specific Files

Apply a rule
Apply a rule only when specific files are modified:

```yaml
if:
  - type: "files"
    modified:
      match: "package.json"
```

### Match File Types

Apply a rule based on file types:

```yaml
if:
  - type: "files"
    modified:
      match: ".*\\.(js|ts|tsx)$"
```

### Match Files in Directory

Apply a rule only when files in a specific directory are changed:

```yaml
if:
  - type: "files"
    modified:
      match: "src/components/.*"
```

### Ignore Certain Files

Apply a rule only when meaningful files are changed (ignoring configuration files):

```yaml
if:
  - type: "files"
    modified:
      match: "src/.*"
      ignore: [".*\\.config.js", "package-lock.json"]
```

### Added Files Only

Apply a rule only when new files are added:

```yaml
if:
  - type: "files"
    added:
      match: "src/.*"
```

## Pattern Matching

The Files Filter supports several pattern matching methods:

1. **Exact match**: `"package.json"`
2. **Glob patterns**: `"src/**/*.js"`
3. **Regular expressions**: `"/^src\/.*\.jsx?$/"` (enclosed in forward slashes)

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get Changed Files">
    The filter retrieves all files changed in the PR, categorized by change type (added, modified, deleted)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Process Added Files">
    If `added` conditions are specified, it checks if added files match the required patterns
  </Step>
  <Step title="Process Modified Files">
    If `modified` conditions are specified, it checks if modified files match the required patterns
  </Step>
  <Step title="Determine Match">
    Returns a match result indicating whether the specified file patterns were found
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Practical Use Cases

### Component-Specific Rules

Apply different rules based on the type of components changed:

```yaml
ruleset:
  - name: "Frontend Tests Required"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.synchronize"
    if:
      - type: "files"
        modified:
          match: "src/components/.*\\.(js|tsx)$"
    validate:
      - type: "dependent"
        files:
          - when: "src/components/(.+)\\.(js|tsx)$"
            require: "src/components/$1.test.(js|tsx)"
    on_failure:
      - comment:
          body: "Frontend component changes require corresponding test files"

  - name: "API Documentation"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.synchronize"
    if:
      - type: "files"
        modified:
          match: "src/api/.*"
    validate:
      - type: "dependent"
        files:
          - when: "src/api/(.+)\\.js$"
            require: "docs/api/$1.md"
    on_failure:
      - comment:
          body: "API changes require updated documentation"
```

### Security Review for Sensitive Files

Require special handling for security-sensitive changes:

```yaml
ruleset:
  - name: "Security Review"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.synchronize"
    if:
      - type: "files"
        modified:
          match: ["src/auth/.*", "src/crypto/.*", "config/security\\..*"]
    on_success:
      - label:
          add: ["security-review-required"]
      - requestReview:
          reviewers: ["security-team-lead"]
      - comment:
          body: |
            This PR modifies security-sensitive files and requires a security review.

            @security-team-lead has been automatically requested as a reviewer.
```

### Different Requirements by File Type

Apply different validation rules based on file type:

```yaml
ruleset:
  - name: "JavaScript Style"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.synchronize"
    if:
      - type: "files"
        modified:
          match: ".*\\.js$"
    validate:
      - type: "dependent"
        files:
          - when: ".*\\.js$"
            require: ".eslintrc.js"

  - name: "CSS Style"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.synchronize"
    if:
      - type: "files"
        modified:
          match: ".*\\.css$"
    validate:
      - type: "dependent"
        files:
          - when: ".*\\.css$"
            require: ".stylelintrc"
```

### Automatic Labeling

Automatically label PRs based on changed files:

```yaml
ruleset:
  - name: "Frontend Label"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.synchronize"
    if:
      - type: "files"
        modified:
          match: "src/frontend/.*"
    on_success:
      - label:
          add: ["frontend"]

  - name: "Backend Label"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.synchronize"
    if:
      - type: "files"
        modified:
          match: "src/backend/.*"
    on_success:
      - label:
          add: ["backend"]

  - name: "Documentation Label"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.synchronize"
    if:
      - type: "files"
        modified:
          match: ["docs/.*", "README\\.md"]
    on_success:
      - label:
          add: ["documentation"]
```

## Best Practices

<Check>Use specific patterns to target exactly the files you care about</Check>
<Check>Group related file patterns for clarity</Check>
<Check>Consider using the ignore patterns to exclude non-substantive changes</Check>
<Check>Test your patterns to ensure they match as expected</Check>

<Warning>
  Overly complex patterns can be difficult to maintain; keep them as simple as possible
</Warning>

## Pattern Examples

Here are some common pattern examples:

| Pattern                 | Matches                                           |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/.*`                | All files in the src directory and subdirectories |
| `.*\\.js$`              | All JavaScript files                              |
| `.*\\.(js\|ts)$`        | All JavaScript and TypeScript files               |
| `src/components/.*`     | All files in src/components and subdirectories    |
| `package\\.json`        | Only the root package.json file                   |
| `/^docs\/api\/.*\.md$/` | Markdown files in the docs/api directory          |
