title: "Milestone Filter"
description: "Filter rules based on PR milestone"
---

The Milestone Filter allows you to apply rules only to pull requests that have (or don't have) specific milestones. This helps target rules based on release planning or project phases.

## Configuration

<ParamField path="type" type="string" required>
  Must be set to `"milestone"`
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="required" type="boolean">
  Whether a milestone is required for the rule to apply
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="match" type="string | string[]">
  Milestone title pattern(s) that should match (supports regex)
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="ignore" type="string | string[]">
  Milestone title pattern(s) that should not match (supports regex)
</ParamField>

## Basic Usage

```yaml
if:
  - type: "milestone"
    match: "v2.0.0"
```

## Examples

### Match Specific Milestone

Apply a rule only to PRs with a specific milestone:

```yaml
if:
  - type: "milestone"
    match: "v2.0.0"
```

### Match Multiple Milestones

Apply a rule to PRs with any of several milestones:

```yaml
if:
  - type: "milestone"
    match: ["v2.0.0", "v2.1.0", "v2.2.0"]
```

### Pattern Matching

Apply a rule to PRs with milestones matching a pattern:

```yaml
if:
  - type: "milestone"
    match: "v2\\..*"
```

### Require Any Milestone

Apply a rule only to PRs that have any milestone set:

```yaml
if:
  - type: "milestone"
    required: true
```

### Exclude Milestones

Apply a rule only to PRs that don't have specific milestones:

```yaml
if:
  - type: "milestone"
    ignore: ["Future", "Backlog"]
```

## Pattern Matching

The Milestone Filter supports several pattern matching methods:

1. **Exact match**: `"v2.0.0"`
2. **Glob patterns**: `"v2.*"`
3. **Regular expressions**: `"/^v2\\.\\d+\\.\\d+$/"` (enclosed in forward slashes)

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get Milestone">
    The filter retrieves the milestone associated with the PR, if any
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check Required">
    If `required` is true, it checks that a milestone is set
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check Match Patterns">
    If `match` is specified, it checks if the milestone title matches any of the patterns
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check Ignore Patterns">
    If `ignore` is specified, it checks if the milestone title matches any of the ignore patterns
  </Step>
  <Step title="Determine Result">
    Returns a match result based on whether the milestone satisfies all conditions
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Practical Use Cases

### Release-Specific Rules

Apply different rules based on release milestones:

```yaml
ruleset:
  - name: "Major Release Rules"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.edited"
      - "pull_request.milestoned"
    if:
      - type: "milestone"
        match: "v[0-9]+\\.0\\.0" # Major version releases
    validate:
      - type: "approvals"
        count:
          min: 3
        include: ["product-manager", "cto"]
    on_failure:
      - comment:
          body: |
            PRs for major releases (v*.0.0) require at least 3 approvals, including from the product manager and CTO.

            Please ensure you get the necessary approvals before merging.

  - name: "Minor Release Rules"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.edited"
      - "pull_request.milestoned"
    if:
      - type: "milestone"
        match: "v[0-9]+\\.[1-9][0-9]*\\.0" # Minor version releases
    validate:
      - type: "approvals"
        count:
          min: 2
        include: ["tech-lead"]
    on_failure:
      - comment:
          body: "PRs for minor releases require at least 2 approvals, including from a tech lead."
```

### Milestone Requirement

Enforce that PRs have a milestone:

```yaml
ruleset:
  - name: "Milestone Required"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.ready_for_review"
    validate:
      - type: "milestone"
        required: true
        message: "PRs must have a milestone assigned"
    on_failure:
      - label:
          add: ["needs-milestone"]
      - comment:
          body: |
            This PR does not have a milestone assigned.

            Please add a milestone to indicate when this change is expected to be released.
```

### Different Tests by Release Type

Run different test requirements based on milestone:

```yaml
ruleset:
  - name: "Stable Release Tests"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.synchronize"
      - "pull_request.milestoned"
    if:
      - type: "milestone"
        match: "v[0-9]+\\.[0-9]+\\.0" # Stable releases (x.y.0)
    validate:
      - type: "label"
        include: ["tested:e2e", "tested:integration", "tested:unit"]
    on_failure:
      - comment:
          body: |
            PRs for stable releases must have all three test labels:
            - tested:e2e
            - tested:integration
            - tested:unit

  - name: "Patch Release Tests"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.synchronize"
      - "pull_request.milestoned"
    if:
      - type: "milestone"
        match: "v[0-9]+\\.[0-9]+\\.[1-9]" # Patch releases (x.y.z where z > 0)
    validate:
      - type: "label"
        include: ["tested:unit"]
    on_failure:
      - comment:
          body: "PRs for patch releases must have the tested:unit label."
```

### Auto-Labeling by Milestone

Automatically add labels based on milestones:

```yaml
ruleset:
  - name: "Milestone Labels"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.milestoned"
      - "pull_request.demilestoned"
    if:
      - type: "milestone"
        match: "v3\\.0\\.0"
    on_success:
      - label:
          add: ["next-major-release"]
          remove: ["current-release", "future-release"]

  - name: "Current Release Label"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.milestoned"
      - "pull_request.demilestoned"
    if:
      - type: "milestone"
        match: "v2\\.[0-9]+\\.[0-9]+"
    on_success:
      - label:
          add: ["current-release"]
          remove: ["next-major-release", "future-release"]

  - name: "Future Release Label"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.milestoned"
      - "pull_request.demilestoned"
    if:
      - type: "milestone"
        match: "v[4-9]\\.[0-9]+\\.[0-9]+"
    on_success:
      - label:
          add: ["future-release"]
          remove: ["current-release", "next-major-release"]
```

## Best Practices

<Check>Use clear, consistent milestone naming conventions</Check>
<Check>Create milestones for all planned releases</Check>
<Check>Document your milestone requirements in contributing guidelines</Check>
<Check>Consider using semantic versioning patterns in milestone names</Check>

<Warning>
  Remember that milestones need to be created manually before they can be assigned to PRs
</Warning>

## Integration with Release Process

The Milestone Filter works best as part of a comprehensive release process:

1. **Create Milestones**: Create milestones for upcoming releases in GitHub
2. **Assign PRs**: Require all PRs to be assigned to a milestone
3. **Filter Rules**: Use the Milestone Filter to apply different requirements based on the target release
4. **Tracking**: Use GitHub's milestone view to track progress toward releases
5. **Release Notes**: Generate release notes based on PRs in each milestone

This approach helps maintain a clear connection between changes and releases.
