title: "Team Filter"
description: "Filter rules based on team membership"
---

The Team Filter allows you to apply rules based on whether the pull request author belongs to specific GitHub teams. This helps create different validation rules for different teams or ensure that only team members can perform certain actions.

## Configuration

<ParamField path="type" type="string" required>
  Must be set to `"team"`
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="match" type="string | string[]">
  Team patterns that the author should belong to (format: "org/team-slug")
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="ignore" type="string | string[]">
  Team patterns that the author should not belong to (format: "org/team-slug")
</ParamField>

## Basic Usage

```yaml
if:
  - type: "team"
    match: "myorg/frontend-team"
```

## Examples

### Match Specific Team

Apply a rule only to PRs authored by members of a specific team:

```yaml
if:
  - type: "team"
    match: "myorg/frontend-team"
```

### Match Multiple Teams

Apply a rule to PRs authored by members of any of several teams:

```yaml
if:
  - type: "team"
    match: ["myorg/frontend-team", "myorg/design-team"]
```

### Exclude Team Members

Apply a rule only to PRs not authored by members of specific teams:

```yaml
if:
  - type: "team"
    ignore: ["myorg/admin-team", "myorg/security-team"]
```

### Combined Team Requirements

Apply complex team membership conditions:

```yaml
if:
  - type: "team"
    match: "myorg/developers"
    ignore: ["myorg/interns", "myorg/contractors"]
```

## Team Format

<Warning>Team names must be in the format `organization/team-slug`</Warning>

For example:

- `mycompany/frontend-team`
- `mycompany/backend-team`
- `myorg/admins`

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get PR Author">
    The filter retrieves the username of the PR author
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check Team Membership">
    For each specified team, it checks if the author is a member of that team
  </Step>
  <Step title="Apply Match Conditions">
    If `match` is specified, it checks if the author belongs to at least one of
    the matched teams
  </Step>
  <Step title="Apply Ignore Conditions">
    If `ignore` is specified, it checks if the author doesn't belong to any of
    the ignored teams
  </Step>
  <Step title="Determine Result">
    Returns a match result based on the team membership checks
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Practical Use Cases

### Team-Specific Validations

Apply different validation rules for different teams:

```yaml
ruleset:
  - name: "Frontend Team Rules"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.synchronize"
    if:
      - type: "team"
        match: "myorg/frontend-team"
      - type: "files"
        modified:
          match: "src/frontend/.*"
    validate:
      - type: "dependent"
        files:
          - when: "src/frontend/components/(.+)\\.jsx$"
            require: "src/frontend/components/$1.test.jsx"
    on_failure:
      - comment:
          body: "Frontend components require test files"

  - name: "Backend Team Rules"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.synchronize"
    if:
      - type: "team"
        match: "myorg/backend-team"
      - type: "files"
        modified:
          match: "src/backend/.*"
    validate:
      - type: "dependent"
        files:
          - when: "src/backend/api/(.+)\\.js$"
            require: "test/backend/api/$1.test.js"
    on_failure:
      - comment:
          body: "Backend API endpoints require test files"
```

### Different Requirements by Experience Level

Apply different rules based on team experience levels:

```yaml
ruleset:
  - name: "Senior Developer Rules"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.ready_for_review"
    if:
      - type: "team"
        match: "myorg/senior-developers"
    validate:
      - type: "approvals"
        count:
          min: 1
    on_success:
      - label:
          add: ["ready-to-merge"]

  - name: "Junior Developer Rules"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.ready_for_review"
    if:
      - type: "team"
        match: "myorg/junior-developers"
    validate:
      - type: "approvals"
        count:
          min: 2
        include: ["senior-reviewer"]
    on_success:
      - label:
          add: ["ready-to-merge"]
    on_failure:
      - comment:
          body: "PRs from junior developers require at least 2 approvals, including from a senior reviewer"
```

### Restricted Operations

Restrict certain operations to specific teams:

```yaml
ruleset:
  - name: "Security File Changes"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.synchronize"
    if:
      - type: "files"
        modified:
          match: ["config/security/.*", "src/auth/.*"]
      - type: "team"
        ignore: "myorg/security-team"
    validate:
      - type: "approvals"
        count:
          min: 3
        include: ["security-lead", "cto"]
    on_failure:
      - label:
          add: ["security-review-required"]
      - comment:
          body: |
            Changes to security-sensitive files from non-security team members
            require additional scrutiny:

            - At least 3 approvals
            - Explicit approval from the security lead and CTO
```

### Team Labeling

Automatically label PRs based on the author's team:

```yaml
ruleset:
  - name: "Frontend Team Label"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
    if:
      - type: "team"
        match: "myorg/frontend-team"
    on_success:
      - label:
          add: ["team: frontend"]

  - name: "Backend Team Label"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
    if:
      - type: "team"
        match: "myorg/backend-team"
    on_success:
      - label:
          add: ["team: backend"]

  - name: "DevOps Team Label"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
    if:
      - type: "team"
        match: "myorg/devops-team"
    on_success:
      - label:
          add: ["team: devops"]
```

## Best Practices

<Check>Organize repository access through GitHub teams</Check>
<Check>Create teams that reflect organizational structure</Check>
<Check>Use descriptive team names</Check>
<Check>Apply least privilege principles to team permissions</Check>

<Warning>
  The GitHub App needs appropriate permissions to check team membership
</Warning>

## Required Permissions

For the Team Filter to work:

1. The GitHub App must have the `members:read` permission
2. The teams must be visible to the GitHub App
3. Teams must be properly set up in the GitHub organization

## Setting Up Teams in GitHub

To create and manage teams:

1. Go to your organization's page
2. Click on "Teams" in the top navigation
3. Click the "New team" button
4. Provide a team name and description
5. Add members to the team
6. Grant repository access as needed

Teams can be nested to reflect your organizational hierarchy, which helps with permission management.
