Rulesets is a GitHub App built with Probot that automates pull request workflows, enforces code quality standards, and streamlines the review process. By defining rules in a YAML configuration file, you can automatically validate pull requests against your team's conventions and trigger appropriate actions based on validation results.

## How It Works

1. Install the Rulesets GitHub App on your repository
2. Create a `.github/Ruleset.yml` configuration file
3. Define your ruleset with events, conditions, validations, and actions
4. When a pull request is created or updated, Rulesets automatically applies your rules

## Example Configuration

```yaml
ruleset:
  - name: "Conventional Commit Format"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.edited"
    validate:
      - type: "title"
        match: "^(feat|fix|docs|style|refactor|perf|test|build|ci|chore|revert)(\\(\\w+\\))?: .+"
        message: "PR title must follow conventional commit format"
    on_success:
      - label:
          add: ["conventional-format"]
    on_failure:
      - comment:
          body: "Please follow the conventional commit format for your PR title"
```

This example rule validates that PR titles follow the conventional commit format, adds a label when they do, and comments when they don't.
