title: "Age Validator"
description: "Validate PR age (time since creation or update)"
---

The Age Validator checks the age of a pull request - how much time has passed since it was created or last updated. This helps identify stale PRs that need attention and enforce timely reviews and updates.

## Configuration

<ParamField path="type" type="string" required>
  Must be set to `"age"`
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="created" type="object">
  Constraints for the time since PR creation
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="created.min" type="number">
  Minimum age in days since creation
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="created.max" type="number">
  Maximum age in days since creation
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="created.message" type="string">
  Custom message for created age constraint failures
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="updated" type="object">
  Constraints for the time since PR was last updated
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="updated.min" type="number">
  Minimum age in days since last update
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="updated.max" type="number">
  Maximum age in days since last update
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="updated.message" type="string">
  Custom message for updated age constraint failures
</ParamField>

## Basic Usage

```yaml
validate:
  - type: "age"
    updated:
      max: 14
      message: "This PR hasn't been updated in over 2 weeks"
```

## Examples

### Identify Stale PRs

Detect PRs that haven't been updated in a while:

```yaml
validate:
  - type: "age"
    updated:
      max: 14
      message: "This PR hasn't been updated in over 2 weeks"
```

### Enforce Update Cooldown

Ensure PRs have had time to be reviewed before merging:

```yaml
validate:
  - type: "age"
    created:
      min: 1
      message: "PRs must be open for at least 24 hours to allow for review"
```

### Expiry Policy

Implement an expiry policy for old PRs:

```yaml
validate:
  - type: "age"
    created:
      max: 30
      message: "This PR is over 30 days old and should be closed or updated"
```

### Combined Age Constraints

Apply multiple age-related constraints:

```yaml
validate:
  - type: "age"
    created:
      max: 30
      message: "This PR is over 30 days old"
    updated:
      max: 14
      message: "This PR hasn't been updated in over 2 weeks"
```

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get Timestamps">
    The validator retrieves the PR's created and updated timestamps
  </Step>
  <Step title="Calculate Ages">
    It calculates the age in days since creation and last update
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check Created Age">
    If `created` constraints are specified, it checks if the age since creation is within limits
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check Updated Age">
    If `updated` constraints are specified, it checks if the age since last update is within limits
  </Step>
  <Step title="Return Result">
    Returns a validation result with status (pass, fail, or error) and a message
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Practical Use Cases

### Stale PR Detection

Automatically label and notify about stale PRs:

```yaml
ruleset:
  - name: "PR Age Check"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.synchronize"
      - "schedule.daily" # This would require additional configuration
    validate:
      - type: "age"
        updated:
          max: 14
          message: "This PR hasn't been updated in over 2 weeks"
    on_failure:
      - label:
          add: ["stale"]
      - comment:
          body: |
            ## Stale Pull Request

            This PR hasn't been updated in over 2 weeks. Please update it or consider closing it.

            If you're still working on this PR, please add a comment or push new changes.
```

### PR Lifecycle Management

Implement a complete PR lifecycle management system:

```yaml
ruleset:
  - name: "Recent PR"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.synchronize"
    validate:
      - type: "age"
        updated:
          max: 7
    on_success:
      - label:
          add: ["active"]
          remove: ["stale", "abandoned"]

  - name: "Stale PR"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.synchronize"
      - "schedule.daily" # This would require additional configuration
    validate:
      - type: "age"
        updated:
          min: 7
          max: 14
    on_success:
      - label:
          add: ["stale"]
          remove: ["active", "abandoned"]
      - comment:
          body: |
            This PR hasn't been updated in over a week. 
            Are you still working on it or do you need help?

  - name: "Abandoned PR"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.synchronize"
      - "schedule.daily" # This would require additional configuration
    validate:
      - type: "age"
        updated:
          min: 30
    on_success:
      - label:
          add: ["abandoned"]
          remove: ["active", "stale"]
      - comment:
          body: |
            This PR has been inactive for 30 days and is now considered abandoned.
            It will be closed in 7 days unless updated.
```

### Code Review Aging

Track how long PRs have been waiting for review:

```yaml
ruleset:
  - name: "Needs Review Reminder"
    when:
      - "pull_request.labeled"
      - "schedule.daily" # This would require additional configuration
    if:
      - type: "label"
        match: "needs-review"
    validate:
      - type: "age"
        updated:
          max: 2
    on_failure:
      - comment:
          body: |
            This PR has been waiting for review for over 2 days.
            @maintainers please review when you have a chance.
```

## Best Practices

<Check>Set reasonable timeframes based on your team's workflow</Check>
<Check>Use age validation as part of a comprehensive PR management strategy</Check>
<Check>Combine with labels to visualize PR status</Check>
<Check>Provide helpful guidance in comments for stale PRs</Check>

<Warning>
  Be mindful of vacation periods and other factors that might legitimately delay PR updates
</Warning>

## Benefits of Age Validation

- **Reduced Staleness**: Prevents PRs from languishing without attention
- **Faster Cycle Time**: Encourages timely reviews and updates
- **Better Communication**: Prompts discussions about delayed PRs
- **Cleaner PR Queue**: Helps identify PRs that should be closed
- **Workflow Visibility**: Makes PR aging explicit and trackable
