title: "Branch Validator"
description: "Validate branch naming conventions"
---

The Branch Validator ensures that the base and head branches of a pull request follow specified naming conventions. This helps maintain consistent branch names that communicate the purpose of changes and follow your team's workflow.

## Configuration

<ParamField path="type" type="string" required>
  Must be set to `"branch"`
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="base" type="object">
  Validation rules for the base branch (the branch you're merging into)
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="base.match" type="string | string[]">
  Pattern(s) that the base branch name should match
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="base.ignore" type="string | string[]">
  Pattern(s) that the base branch name should not match
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="base.message" type="string">
  Custom message for base branch validation failures
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="head" type="object">
  Validation rules for the head branch (the branch with your changes)
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="head.match" type="string | string[]">
  Pattern(s) that the head branch name should match
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="head.ignore" type="string | string[]">
  Pattern(s) that the head branch name should not match
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="head.message" type="string">
  Custom message for head branch validation failures
</ParamField>

## Basic Usage

```yaml
validate:
  - type: "branch"
    head:
      match: "^(feature|bugfix|hotfix)/[a-z0-9-_]+"
      message: "Branch name must follow pattern: type/description (e.g., feature/add-login)"
```

## Examples

### Head Branch Naming Convention

Enforce a specific pattern for feature branches:

```yaml
validate:
  - type: "branch"
    head:
      match: "^(feature|bugfix|hotfix|release)/[a-z0-9-_]+"
      message: "Branch name must start with feature/, bugfix/, hotfix/, or release/"
```

### Protected Base Branches

Ensure PRs only target specific base branches:

```yaml
validate:
  - type: "branch"
    base:
      match: ["main", "develop", "release-.*"]
      message: "PRs can only target main, develop, or release branches"
```

### Prevent Direct Production Changes

Prevent direct PRs to production branches:

```yaml
validate:
  - type: "branch"
    base:
      match: "production"
      ignore: true
      message: "Direct PRs to production are not allowed. Please target staging first."
```

### Combined Rules

Validate both base and head branches:

```yaml
validate:
  - type: "branch"
    base:
      match: ["main", "develop"]
      message: "PRs must target either main or develop"
    head:
      match: "^(feature|bugfix|hotfix)/[a-z0-9-_]+"
      ignore: ["wip/.*", "temp/.*"]
      message: "Feature branches must follow naming convention and not be WIP or temporary"
```

## Pattern Matching

The Branch Validator supports several pattern matching methods:

1. **Exact match**: `"main"`
2. **Glob patterns**: `"release-*"`
3. **Regular expressions**: `"/^feature\/.*$/"` (enclosed in forward slashes)

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get Branch Names">
    The validator extracts the base and head branch names from the PR
  </Step>
  <Step title="Validate Base Branch">
    If base branch rules are specified, checks if the base branch matches requirements
  </Step>
  <Step title="Validate Head Branch">
    If head branch rules are specified, checks if the head branch matches requirements
  </Step>
  <Step title="Return Result">
    Returns a validation result with status (pass, fail, or error) and a message
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Practical Use Cases

### GitFlow Branch Validation

Enforce GitFlow workflow branch naming:

```yaml
ruleset:
  - name: "GitFlow Branch Names"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
    validate:
      - type: "branch"
        base:
          match: ["main", "develop", "release-.*"]
          message: "Base branch must be main, develop, or a release branch"
        head:
          match: "^(feature|bugfix|hotfix|release)/[a-z0-9-_]+"
          message: "Branch names must follow GitFlow convention: type/description"
    on_failure:
      - comment:
          body: |
            ## Invalid Branch Name

            Please follow our GitFlow branch naming conventions:

            - Feature branches: `feature/description`
            - Bug fixes: `bugfix/description`
            - Hotfixes: `hotfix/description`
            - Release branches: `release/version`

            {{ validation_summary }}
```

### Jira Issue References

Enforce Jira issue IDs in branch names:

```yaml
validate:
  - type: "branch"
    head:
      match: "^(feature|bugfix|hotfix)/[A-Z]+-[0-9]+-[a-z0-9-]+"
      message: "Branch name must include Jira issue ID (e.g., feature/PROJ-123-description)"
```

### Different Rules by Team

Apply different branch naming rules for different parts of the codebase:

```yaml
ruleset:
  - name: "Frontend Branch Names"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
    if:
      - type: "files"
        modified:
          match: "frontend/.*"
    validate:
      - type: "branch"
        head:
          match: "^frontend/(feature|bugfix)/[a-z0-9-_]+"
    on_failure:
      - comment:
          body: "Frontend branches should follow pattern: frontend/type/description"

  - name: "Backend Branch Names"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
    if:
      - type: "files"
        modified:
          match: "backend/.*"
    validate:
      - type: "branch"
        head:
          match: "^backend/(feature|bugfix)/[a-z0-9-_]+"
    on_failure:
      - comment:
          body: "Backend branches should follow pattern: backend/type/description"
```

## Best Practices

<Check>Document your branch naming conventions in your contributing guidelines</Check>
<Check>Use clear, descriptive patterns that communicate the intent</Check>
<Check>Consider your Git workflow (GitFlow, GitHub Flow, etc.) when defining conventions</Check>
<Check>Provide helpful error messages explaining the expected format</Check>

<Warning>
  Be aware that branch names are case-sensitive in Git/GitHub
</Warning>

## Branch Naming Strategy Tips

Effective branch names should:

1. **Indicate purpose**: Use prefixes like `feature/`, `bugfix/`, `hotfix/`
2. **Reference context**: Include ticket numbers or brief descriptions
3. **Use separators consistently**: Choose either hyphens or underscores
4. **Be reasonably concise**: Avoid overly long branch names
5. **Avoid spaces and special characters**: Use dashes or underscores instead
