title: "Description Validator"
description: "Validate PR description content and format"
---

The Description Validator ensures that pull request descriptions meet specified requirements, such as minimum length, required sections, or specific content patterns. This helps maintain informative PR descriptions that provide adequate context for reviewers.

## Configuration

<ParamField path="type" type="string" required>
  Must be set to `"description"`
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="no_empty" type="boolean">
  Whether empty descriptions are allowed (true = not allowed)
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="length" type="object">
  Description length constraints
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="length.min" type="number">
  Minimum description length in characters
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="length.max" type="number">
  Maximum description length in characters
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="match" type="string | string[]">
  Regex pattern(s) that the description should match
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="message" type="string">
  Custom message to display when validation fails
</ParamField>

## Basic Usage

```yaml
validate:
  - type: "description"
    no_empty: true
    length:
      min: 50
    message: "Please provide a meaningful PR description (minimum 50 characters)"
```

## Examples

### Require Non-Empty Description

Ensure PR descriptions aren't empty:

```yaml
validate:
  - type: "description"
    no_empty: true
    message: "PR description cannot be empty"
```

### Minimum Description Length

Require detailed descriptions:

```yaml
validate:
  - type: "description"
    length:
      min: 100
    message: "PR description must be at least 100 characters"
```

### Pattern Matching

Require specific sections in the description:

```yaml
validate:
  - type: "description"
    match: "(What|Why|How).*"
    message: "PR description must include What, Why, or How sections"
```

### Multiple Requirements

Combine multiple requirements:

```yaml
validate:
  - type: "description"
    no_empty: true
    length:
      min: 50
      max: 2000
    match: "## (Background|Changes|Testing)"
    message: "PR description must include Background, Changes, or Testing sections and be 50-2000 characters"
```

## Pattern Matching

The Description Validator uses JavaScript regular expressions for pattern matching:

- Patterns are case-sensitive by default
- Use `i` flag for case-insensitive matching: `"/pattern/i"`
- You can specify multiple patterns as an array
- Pattern matching is done against the entire description

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Retrieve Description">
    The validator retrieves the PR description from the GitHub event context
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check Empty">
    If `no_empty` is true, checks if the description is empty
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check Length">
    If `length` is specified, verifies the description length is within the specified range
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check Pattern">
    If `match` is specified, checks if the description matches any of the regex patterns
  </Step>
  <Step title="Return Result">
    Returns a validation result with status (pass, fail, or error) and a message
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Practical Use Cases

### Structured Description Template

Enforce a structured PR description format:

````yaml
ruleset:
  - name: "PR Description Format"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.edited"
    validate:
      - type: "description"
        match: "## What(.|\n)*## Why(.|\n)*## How"
        message: "PR description must include What, Why, and How sections"
    on_failure:
      - comment:
          body: |
            Please structure your PR description with the following sections:

            ```
            ## What
            [Description of the changes]

            ## Why
            [Reason for the changes]

            ## How
            [How you implemented the changes]
            ```
````

### Issue Reference Check

Ensure PR descriptions reference an issue:

```yaml
validate:
  - type: "description"
    match: "(fixes|closes|resolves) #\\d+"
    message: "PR description must reference an issue (e.g., 'fixes #123')"
```

### Testing Information

Require information about testing:

```yaml
validate:
  - type: "description"
    match: "## (Testing|Test Plan)"
    message: "PR description must include a Testing or Test Plan section"
```

### Different Requirements by Branch

Apply stricter requirements for production branches:

```yaml
ruleset:
  - name: "Main Branch Description"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.edited"
    if:
      - type: "branch"
        base:
          match: "main"
    validate:
      - type: "description"
        no_empty: true
        length:
          min: 200
        match: "## (Summary|Changes|Testing|Risks)"
    on_failure:
      - comment:
          body: "PRs to main branch require detailed descriptions with Summary, Changes, Testing, and Risks sections"

  - name: "Development Branch Description"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.edited"
    if:
      - type: "branch"
        base:
          match: "develop"
    validate:
      - type: "description"
        no_empty: true
        length:
          min: 50
    on_failure:
      - comment:
          body: "PRs to develop branch require a description of at least 50 characters"
```

## Best Practices

<Check>Provide a PR template to guide contributors</Check>
<Check>Keep requirements reasonable and aligned with your team's workflow</Check>
<Check>Give clear feedback when validation fails</Check>
<Check>Consider different requirements for different types of changes</Check>

<Warning>
  Very strict requirements might frustrate contributors, especially for simple changes
</Warning>

## Template Integration

To maximize effectiveness, combine this validator with a PR template in your repository:

1. Create a file at `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`
2. Include the required sections and guidance
3. Configure the validator to check for these sections

This way, contributors automatically get a template that helps them meet your requirements.
