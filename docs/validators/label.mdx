title: "Label Validator"
description: "Validate PR labels"
---

The Label Validator ensures that pull requests have the required labels and don't have forbidden labels. This helps categorize PRs correctly and enforce workflow stages.

## Configuration

<ParamField path="type" type="string" required>
  Must be set to `"label"`
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="count" type="object">
  Requirements for the number of labels
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="count.min" type="number">
  Minimum number of labels required
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="count.max" type="number">
  Maximum number of labels allowed
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="include" type="string | string[]">
  Label pattern(s) that must be present (supports regex)
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="exclude" type="string | string[]">
  Label pattern(s) that must not be present (supports regex)
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="message" type="string">
  Custom message to display when validation fails
</ParamField>

## Basic Usage

```yaml
validate:
  - type: "label"
    include: ["bug", "enhancement", "documentation"]
    message: "PR must have at least one type label (bug, enhancement, or documentation)"
```

## Examples

### Required Labels

Ensure PRs have at least one specific label:

```yaml
validate:
  - type: "label"
    include: ["bug", "enhancement", "documentation"]
    message: "PR must have at least one type label (bug, enhancement, or documentation)"
```

### Forbidden Labels

Prevent merging PRs with certain labels:

```yaml
validate:
  - type: "label"
    exclude: ["do-not-merge", "wip", "on-hold"]
    message: "PR cannot be merged with 'do-not-merge', 'wip', or 'on-hold' labels"
```

### Label Count

Enforce a minimum and maximum number of labels:

```yaml
validate:
  - type: "label"
    count:
      min: 2
      max: 5
    message: "PR must have between 2 and 5 labels"
```

### Pattern Matching

Use patterns to match label categories:

```yaml
validate:
  - type: "label"
    include: ["type:.+", "priority:.+"]
    message: "PR must have both a type and priority label"
```

### Combined Requirements

Combine multiple label requirements:

```yaml
validate:
  - type: "label"
    count:
      min: 3
    include: ["type:.+", "component:.+"]
    exclude: ["do-not-merge", "wip"]
    message: "PR must have at least 3 labels including type and component labels, and cannot have 'do-not-merge' or 'wip' labels"
```

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get Labels">
    The validator retrieves all labels currently applied to the PR
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check Count">
    If `count` is specified, it verifies the number of labels meets requirements
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check Required Labels">
    If `include` is specified, it checks that at least one matching label is present for each pattern
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check Forbidden Labels">
    If `exclude` is specified, it checks that no matching labels are present
  </Step>
  <Step title="Return Result">
    Returns a validation result with status (pass, fail, or error) and a message
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Pattern Matching

The Label Validator supports several pattern matching methods:

1. **Exact match**: `"bug"`
2. **Glob patterns**: `"type-*"`
3. **Regular expressions**: `"/^type:.+$/"` (enclosed in forward slashes)

## Practical Use Cases

### PR Type Categorization

Ensure PRs are properly categorized:

```yaml
ruleset:
  - name: "PR Type Labels"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.labeled"
      - "pull_request.unlabeled"
    validate:
      - type: "label"
        include:
          [
            "type:bug",
            "type:feature",
            "type:refactor",
            "type:docs",
            "type:test",
          ]
        message: "PR must have a type label"
    on_failure:
      - comment:
          body: |
            Please add one of the following type labels to your PR:
            - `type:bug` - Bug fixes
            - `type:feature` - New features
            - `type:refactor` - Code refactoring
            - `type:docs` - Documentation changes
            - `type:test` - Test additions/changes
```

### Release Readiness

Validate that PRs are ready for release:

```yaml
ruleset:
  - name: "Release Readiness"
    when:
      - "pull_request.labeled"
      - "pull_request.unlabeled"
    if:
      - type: "branch"
        base:
          match: "main"
    validate:
      - type: "label"
        include: ["reviewed", "tested"]
        exclude: ["wip", "do-not-merge", "needs-rebase"]
    on_success:
      - label:
          add: ["ready-to-merge"]
    on_failure:
      - label:
          remove: ["ready-to-merge"]
```

### Changelog Categories

Enforce changelog categorization:

```yaml
ruleset:
  - name: "Changelog Categories"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.labeled"
      - "pull_request.unlabeled"
    validate:
      - type: "label"
        include:
          [
            "changelog:added",
            "changelog:changed",
            "changelog:deprecated",
            "changelog:removed",
            "changelog:fixed",
            "changelog:security",
            "changelog:none",
          ]
        message: "PR must have a changelog label"
    on_failure:
      - comment:
          body: |
            Please add a changelog label to indicate how this change should be categorized in the changelog:
            - `changelog:added` - New features
            - `changelog:changed` - Changes in existing functionality
            - `changelog:deprecated` - Soon-to-be removed features
            - `changelog:removed` - Removed features
            - `changelog:fixed` - Bug fixes
            - `changelog:security` - Security fixes
            - `changelog:none` - Changes that don't affect the changelog
```

### Component Labeling

Ensure changes are associated with specific components:

```yaml
ruleset:
  - name: "Component Labeling"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.labeled"
      - "pull_request.unlabeled"
    validate:
      - type: "label"
        include: ["component:.+"]
        message: "PR must have a component label"
    on_failure:
      - comment:
          body: |
            Please add a component label to your PR (e.g., `component:frontend`, `component:api`, `component:database`).

            This helps with release notes and tracking changes across components.
```

## Best Practices

<Check>Use a consistent label naming scheme</Check>
<Check>Document your label requirements in contributing guidelines</Check>
<Check>Create labels in your repository before using them in rules</Check>
<Check>Use label colors to make categories visually distinguishable</Check>

<Warning>
  Don't require too many labels, as it creates friction for contributors
</Warning>

## Using with PR Creation Templates

To help contributors apply the right labels from the start, you can use GitHub's PR template forms:

```yaml
# .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/form.yml
name: Pull Request
description: Create a new pull request
body:
  - type: dropdown
    id: type
    attributes:
      label: Type
      description: What kind of change does this PR introduce?
      options:
        - Bug fix
        - New feature
        - Documentation
        - Refactoring
        - Performance improvement
    validations:
      required: true
  - type: dropdown
    id: component
    attributes:
      label: Component
      description: Which component is affected?
      options:
        - Frontend
        - Backend
        - API
        - Database
        - Documentation
    validations:
      required: true
```

Then use GitHub Actions to apply labels based on the form inputs.
