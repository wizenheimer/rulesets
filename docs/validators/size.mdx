title: "Size Validator"
description: "Validate PR size (files, additions, deletions)"
---

The Size Validator ensures that pull requests don't exceed specified size limits. This helps maintain manageable PRs that are easier to review and less likely to introduce bugs.

## Configuration

<ParamField path="type" type="string" required>
  Must be set to `"size"`
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="files" type="number">
  Maximum number of files that can be changed
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="total" type="number">
  Maximum total number of lines changed (additions + deletions)
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="addition" type="number">
  Maximum number of line additions
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="deletion" type="number">
  Maximum number of line deletions
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="ignore" type="string | string[]">
  File patterns to ignore when calculating size
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="message" type="string">
  Custom message to display when validation fails
</ParamField>

## Basic Usage

```yaml
validate:
  - type: "size"
    files: 10
    total: 500
    message: "This PR is too large. Please split it into smaller PRs."
```

## Examples

### Simple Size Limit

Limit the number of files changed:

```yaml
validate:
  - type: "size"
    files: 10
    message: "PRs should modify no more than 10 files"
```

### Detailed Size Constraints

Set limits for files, additions, and deletions:

```yaml
validate:
  - type: "size"
    files: 15
    addition: 500
    deletion: 200
    message: "PR exceeds size limits. Keep PRs focused and manageable."
```

### Ignore Certain Files

Exclude certain files from size calculations:

```yaml
validate:
  - type: "size"
    files: 10
    total: 500
    ignore:
      - "package-lock.json"
      - "yarn.lock"
      - "*.generated.ts"
    message: "PR is too large (excluding dependency lock files and generated code)"
```

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Calculate Size">
    The validator calculates the PR size metrics:
    - Number of files changed
    - Lines added
    - Lines deleted
    - Total changes (additions + deletions)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Apply Filters">
    If `ignore` patterns are specified, files matching these patterns are excluded from calculations
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check Limits">
    Checks if any of the specified limits are exceeded
  </Step>
  <Step title="Return Result">
    Returns a validation result with status (pass, fail, or error) and a message
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Practical Use Cases

### Different Size Limits by Branch

Apply stricter size limits for production branches:

```yaml
ruleset:
  - name: "Size Limits - Production"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.synchronize"
    if:
      - type: "branch"
        base:
          match: "main"
    validate:
      - type: "size"
        files: 10
        total: 300
    on_failure:
      - comment:
          body: "PRs to main branch must be small and focused (max 10 files, 300 lines)"

  - name: "Size Limits - Development"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.synchronize"
    if:
      - type: "branch"
        base:
          match: "develop"
    validate:
      - type: "size"
        files: 20
        total: 500
    on_failure:
      - comment:
          body: "PRs to develop branch should be reasonably sized (max 20 files, 500 lines)"
```

### Different Limits by PR Type

Different size expectations based on PR type:

```yaml
ruleset:
  - name: "Feature PR Size"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.synchronize"
    if:
      - type: "title"
        match: "^feat: .*"
    validate:
      - type: "size"
        files: 15
        total: 500
    on_failure:
      - label:
          add: ["large-feature"]

  - name: "Bug Fix PR Size"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.synchronize"
    if:
      - type: "title"
        match: "^fix: .*"
    validate:
      - type: "size"
        files: 5
        total: 200
    on_failure:
      - label:
          add: ["large-bugfix"]
```

### Auto-Label by Size

Label PRs based on their size:

```yaml
ruleset:
  - name: "PR Size Labeling"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.synchronize"
    on_success:
      - label:
          remove: ["size: small", "size: medium", "size: large"]

  - name: "Small PR"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.synchronize"
    if:
      - type: "size"
        files:
          max: 5
        total:
          max: 100
    on_success:
      - label:
          add: ["size: small"]

  - name: "Medium PR"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.synchronize"
    if:
      - type: "size"
        files:
          min: 6
          max: 15
        total:
          min: 101
          max: 500
    on_success:
      - label:
          add: ["size: medium"]

  - name: "Large PR"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.synchronize"
    if:
      - type: "size"
        files:
          min: 16
        total:
          min: 501
    on_success:
      - label:
          add: ["size: large"]
```

## Best Practices

<Check>Set reasonable size limits based on your project's needs</Check>
<Check>Consider ignoring files that change often or are auto-generated</Check>
<Check>Provide constructive feedback for large PRs</Check>
<Check>Define different limits for different types of changes</Check>

<Warning>
  Be flexible - some changes legitimately require larger PRs, such as major refactoring
</Warning>

## Benefits of Limiting PR Size

- **Easier Review**: Smaller PRs are easier and faster to review
- **Higher Quality**: Issues are less likely to be missed in smaller changes
- **Faster Feedback**: Contributors get feedback sooner on smaller changes
- **Lower Risk**: Smaller changes have lower risk of introducing bugs
- **Better History**: More granular commit history is easier to understand and bisect
