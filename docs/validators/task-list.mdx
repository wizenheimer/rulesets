title: "Task List Validator"
description: "Validate task list completion in PR descriptions"
---

The Task List Validator ensures that task lists (checkboxes) in pull request descriptions are completed. This is useful for enforcing pre-merge checklists, ensuring contributors follow important steps before their PRs are merged.

## Configuration

<ParamField path="type" type="string" required>
  Must be set to `"taskList"`
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="include" type="string | string[]">
  Section heading patterns to validate (checks task lists in these sections)
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="message" type="string">
  Custom message to display when validation fails
</ParamField>

## Basic Usage

```yaml
validate:
  - type: "taskList"
    include: ["Checklist"]
    message: "Please complete all items in the PR checklist"
```

## Examples

### Simple Checklist Validation

Ensure all tasks in the "Checklist" section are completed:

```yaml
validate:
  - type: "taskList"
    include: "Checklist"
    message: "Please complete all items in the PR checklist"
```

### Multiple Sections

Check tasks in multiple sections:

```yaml
validate:
  - type: "taskList"
    include: ["Prerequisites", "Testing Checklist", "Documentation"]
    message: "Please complete all tasks in the required sections"
```

### Pattern Matching

Use patterns to match section headings:

```yaml
validate:
  - type: "taskList"
    include: [".*Checklist.*", "Pre-?merge( Tasks)?"]
    message: "Please complete all pre-merge tasks"
```

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Parse Description">
    The validator parses the PR description to identify markdown sections and task lists
  </Step>
  <Step title="Identify Sections">
    It identifies sections that match the patterns specified in `include`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check Task Lists">
    For each matching section, it verifies all task list items are checked
  </Step>
  <Step title="Return Result">
    Returns a validation result with status (pass, fail, or error) and a message
  </Step>
</Steps>

The validator looks for Markdown task lists in the format:

```markdown
- [ ] Unchecked task
- [x] Checked task
```

## Example PR Template

To make the most of this validator, create a PR template with task lists:

```markdown
## Description

[Describe your changes here]

## Checklist

- [ ] Code follows the style guidelines
- [ ] I have performed a self-review
- [ ] I have added tests for my changes
- [ ] Documentation has been updated
- [ ] The build passes locally
```

Save this template as `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` in your repository.

## Practical Use Cases

### Pre-Merge Checklist

Ensure contributors confirm important checks before merging:

```yaml
ruleset:
  - name: "Pre-Merge Checklist"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.edited"
      - "pull_request.ready_for_review"
    validate:
      - type: "taskList"
        include: "Checklist"
    on_failure:
      - label:
          add: ["checklist-incomplete"]
      - comment:
          body: |
            ## Incomplete Checklist

            Please complete all items in the PR checklist before requesting review.

            This helps ensure all our quality standards are met.
```

### Different Checklists by PR Type

Apply different checklists based on the type of PR:

```yaml
ruleset:
  - name: "Feature PR Checklist"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.edited"
    if:
      - type: "title"
        match: "^feat: .*"
    validate:
      - type: "
include: "Feature Checklist"
    on_failure:
      - comment:
          body: |
            Please complete the Feature Checklist section in your PR description.

            This should confirm:
            - Feature requirements are met
            - Tests are added
            - Documentation is updated
            - Feature is backwards compatible (if applicable)

  - name: "Bug Fix Checklist"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.edited"
    if:
      - type: "title"
        match: "^fix: .*"
    validate:
      - type: "taskList"
        include: "Bug Fix Checklist"
    on_failure:
      - comment:
          body: |
            Please complete the Bug Fix Checklist section in your PR description.

            This should confirm:
            - Root cause is identified
            - Test case reproduces the issue
            - Fix addresses the root cause
            - Regression tests are added
```

### Security Checklist

Enforce a security checklist for certain types of changes:

```yaml
ruleset:
  - name: "Security Checklist"
    when:
      - "pull_request.opened"
      - "pull_request.edited"
    if:
      - type: "files"
        modified:
          match: "src/(auth|security)/.*"
    validate:
      - type: "taskList"
        include: "Security Considerations"
    on_failure:
      - label:
          add: ["security-review-needed"]
      - comment:
          body: |
            ## Security Checklist Required

            Changes to security-related code require completing the Security Considerations checklist.

            Please update your PR description to include this section with all items checked.
```

## Specialized PR Templates

You can create specialized PR templates for different scenarios by using directories:

1. Create a directory: `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/`
2. Add template files like:
   - `feature.md` - Template for feature PRs
   - `bugfix.md` - Template for bug fixes
   - `security.md` - Template for security-related changes

Contributors can then use the template that fits their PR:

```
https://github.com/username/repo/compare/main...branch?template=feature.md
```

## Best Practices

<Check>Keep checklists focused and relevant</Check>
<Check>Include the most important checks that are often forgotten</Check>
<Check>Explain why each check is important</Check>
<Check>Group related items in sensible categories</Check>

<Warning>
  Don't make checklists too long or contributors might check items without properly considering them
</Warning>

## Customizing Feedback

Provide helpful guidance when tasks are incomplete:

```yaml
on_failure:
  - comment:
      body: |
        ## Incomplete PR Checklist

        Your PR is missing some completed items from the checklist. 

        Specifically:
        {{ validation_summary }}

        These checks help us maintain quality and consistency.
        Please review each item carefully and check it off when completed.
```
